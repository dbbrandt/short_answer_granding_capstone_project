1.1.0 the prototype program gives a general idea of what the end product will do, without the time and effort to write out the entire program.
1.1.0 to show that a certain part of the program works as it is supposed to
1.1.0 Prototype programming is an approach to programming that enables one to take an organized approach to developing an effective program with minimal errors and a strategic pattern when solving a problem. i. e. book gave an example of a costumer withdrawing money from a bank, the approach that was taking on a pseudo code level during the OOA or Design lvl before proceeding into creating a solution.
1.2.0 Refining and possibly the design if the testing phase reveals problems in the design.
1.2.1 Production can be affected if the program is unworkable in its current form which will lead to a later production time than originally estimated.
1.2.2 Also affects coding because after testing you may need to rewrite the code for the program to remove errors.
1.2.0 The implementation phase and the maintenance phase are effected
1.2.0 Verification, coding, refining the solution and maintenance are all influenced by the testing stage.
1.2.0 In RUP the stages in the software life cycle are influenced by the testing stage is: Elaboration phase-refined progject vision, iterative devilopment of core system, development of system requirements, more accurate time and cost estimates.
1.2.1 Construction phase-iterative development of remaining system.
1.2.2 Transition phase-testing and deployment of the system.

1.2.0 Directly: Refining, coding.
1.2.1 Because Refining is right before the Testing Phase and Coding is right after the Testing Phase.
1.2.2 Indirectly: Production, Maintenance.
1.2.3 Because Refining occurs before these last two stages in the Software Life Cycle.
1.2.0 Testing, refining, production, and maintenance.
1.2.0 Depending on how the work is done, Testing is spread throughout the process as to prevent errors from showing up later on due to lack of foresight.
1.2.0 Elaboration, construction, and transition.
1.2.0 All stages are influenced except setting the program requirements.

1.2.0 coding
1.2.0 The Individual components and steps such as analysis, design, and implementing code as well as the entire system are tested for execution of the requirements identified during the analysis stage. i. e. Main output
1.3.0 Modularability, the ability to reuse parts of the program later in another program sometimes with completely different goals for the program.
1.3.1 Also it makes it easier to debug code by dividing up the code into classes that each do a specific job and when the program fails at one job you only have one class to debug.
1.3.2 Good for security purposes because it allows you to let someone use a program which sorts lists without having to give them access to the source code.
1.3.3 ALso allows you to use inheritance and polymorphism.
1.3.0 This type of programming is more flexible, making it easier to add and modify the program.
1.3.1 It is also a type of a fail safe program, you check each individual module.
1.3.2 This eliminates redundant code and makes the program easier to read for other programmers.
1.3.3 When debugging the program it is easier to track down the source of a problem within a module rather than a 2 million line program.
1.3.0 The main advantages to object-oriented programming are that existing classes can be reused and program maintenance and verification are easier.
1.3.0 The advantages is that OOP allows us to build classes of objects.

1.3.2 Inheritance-Classes can inherit properties from other classes.
1.3.3 Polymorphism-Objects can determine appropriate operations at execution time.
1.3.0 Some advantages are existing classes can be reused and program maintenance and verification are easier to accomplish.
1.3.0 Object oriented programming allows programmers to use an object with classes that can be changed and manipulated while not affecting the entire object at once.
1.3.1 The classes all hold attrubutes that affect the object.
1.3.0 Reusable components, Extensibility, Maintainability, it reduces large problems into smaller more manageable problems.

1.3.0 One of the main advantages is you can hide inner details a technique known by encapsulation.
1.3.1 Objects combine the data and operations but you cannot see how it works.
1.3.2 Another advantage is you can reuse classes that have been defined earlier in the program, a method known as inheritance.
1.3.3 Finally another advantage is objects can determine appropriate operations at execution time a technique known as polymorphism.
1.3.0 Existing classes can be reused, and program maintenance and verification are easier.
1.3.0 Using different modules allows for easier debugging
1.3.0 Data encapsulation concept, the use of functions or methods to manipulate data.
1.3.0 Modular, reusable code, allowing faster deployment of solutions, and a more general view of a solution.
1.3.0 Coding and Debugging programs are usually easier, as either the compiler will specify the object that is working incorrectly, or the function an object was assigned to will be easier to identify.
1.3.1 The code itself also looks more organized and is easier to read and will help to avoid redundant coding.
1.3.2 Post-programming maintenance is also easier.
1.3.3 Also, modules can be reused several times in other programs without too much hassle.
1.3.4 Abstraction is the art of breaking down one big problem into smaller, simpler problems and solving them.
1.3.5 Many of the smaller problems are shared between unique complex problems, and creating modules to these solve these smaller repeated problems can save time when you encounter them again.
1.3.0 Variables can remain private.
1.3.1 The code is easily modified and reusable, as well as easily implemented.
1.3.2 Not to mention easier to read and follow along as an observer.
1.3.0 Data Abstraction and control ... it is possible to isolate elements from other elements a lot easier and prevent tampering of data.
1.3.0 Encapsulation Objects use operations without knowing how the operation works.
1.3.1 Inheritance cuts redundancy by reusing earlier classes.
1.3.2 Polymorphism objects select the correct operation to use in the situation.
1.3.0 They make it easier to reuse and adapt previously written code and they separate complex programs into smaller, easier to understand classes.
1.3.0 Existing classes can be reused, Program maintenance and verification are easier
1.3.0 Existing classes can be feused, Program maintenance and verification are easier
1.3.0 the main advantages to object-oriented programming is data abstraction, easier maintenance, and re-usability.

1.3.2 Programming is easier and more manageable.
1.3.0 Existing classes can be reused, program maintenance and verification are easier.
1.3.0 existing classes can be reused program maintenance and verification are easier
1.3.0 Well for one encapsulation the values of the variables inside an object are private, unless methods are written to pass info outside of the object.
1.3.1 As well as Inheritance where each subclass inherits all variables and methods of its super class.
1.3.2 Example in the book included obj clock and how obj alarm would still use clock from the first class.

1.5.0 Is a method or identifier I would say, we use to bind a data object to memory location; which is then stored in a location that can be accessed when and manipulated later when the variable name is called.
1.6.0 They can be declared right before they are used, but it is a good practice to declare them at the beginning of the program and label what they are food.
1.6.0 In the Function main -LRB- -RRB- before using the variable.
1.6.0 Local variables are declared inside the method or function they will be used in at the beginning of the method.
1.6.1 Global variables are declared outside of any function or method, generally before functions are defined.
1.6.0 Variables are declared where ever it is defined either inside a block locally or outside a block globally.
1.6.0 Variables are declared before they are actually used.
1.6.1 They can be declared before main -LRB- -RRB- to use globally
1.6.0 For good programing practice they should be declared before main -LRB- -RRB- , but should at least be declared before they are used.
1.6.0 They can be declared globally just before the main method -LRB- but also outside of it -RRB- ... or variables can be subject to only the method they are scoped within, but would still be declared at the beginning of that method -LRB- but inside of it -RRB- .
1.6.0 local variables are declared inside the method while global variables are declared in the body.
1.6.0 Any where in the main function.
1.6.0 Globally for an entire program, and locally for individual functions -LRB- including FOR statements -RRB-
1.6.0 They are usually declared at the beginning before they can be used in the program.
1.6.1 They always contain a name and a data type.
1.6.0 Inside the method.
1.6.0 at the top
1.6.0 Global variables are declared in the body of the code.
1.6.1 Local variables are declared in the function they are to be used -LRB- unless the function is being passed a variable -RRB- .
1.6.2 Variables should always be declared before use.
1.6.0 Variables are usually declared at the beginning of a module of C plus plus code.
1.6.0 In the main function, usually at the top of code.

1.6.0 anywhere, but where you declare them depends on where you want them to be accessible -LRB- their scope -RRB-
1.6.0 It depends if it s a global then they have to be declared out side the source code to be used in every scope however a local variable is one declared in a local function etc. which obviously doesn t need to be declared outside the variable seeing how it is used for the function or block its being called for.
1.7.0 "The do statement first evaluates the condition and then executes the lines of code in the statement 0 or more times.
1.7.1 The do while statement executes the lines of code and then it evaluates the condition.
1.7.2 "
1.7.0 do ... while statements evaluate whether or not to loop after running the block contained within it at least once.
1.7.1 So the main differance is that while statements have a possibility of never being used.
1.7.2 Do ... while statements on the other hand are always run at least once before evaluating whether to run again.
1.7.0 The main difference between a while and a do ... while loop is that the do ... while loop always cycles through the loop at least once, but the while loop does not always do so.
1.7.0 While loop used to execute a block of code as long as some condition is true.
1.7.1 A do ... while loop used to execute a block of code as long as some condition is satisfied.
1.7.2 The difference between while and do ... while is while loop tests its condition before the execution of its contents and the do ... while loop tests its condition after the execution of its contents at least once.
1.7.0 The termination condition of a do ... while statement is usually at the end of the loop so it will run at least once.
1.7.1 As for the while statement, if the condition is false to begin with, then the loop will never run.
1.7.0 A while loop will check the statement to make sure it is true before executing.
1.7.1 A do while loop will execute before checking the statement to see if it should run again.
1.7.0 A while statement will test the condition of the while loop FIRST there is a chance the loop will never run.
1.7.1 A do ... while loop will ALWAYS run once, and then the while test will determine if it will run again.
1.7.0 a do while loop always executes once.
1.7.1 A while loop 's conditional statement has to be true for it to run.
1.7.0 WHILE statement-The condition is checked for validity, then is repeated until the conditon is false.
1.7.1 Do ... WHILE statement --The code is performed at least once then checked for valid condition.
1.7.2 Will continue to
1.7.0 while statements will evaluate the statement BEFORE executing a cycle of the loop, including the first cycle, meaning that a while loop will not always execute.
1.7.1 A do ... while will run evaluate the statement AFTER running through a cycle of the loop, ensuring that the loop always executes at least one time.
1.7.0 The main difference between a do and a do ... while statement is in a do ... while statement is the statements in a do block are always executed atleast once.
1.7.1 The while statement will only execute if its condition is true.
1.7.0 The loop of a do ... while statement always executes once.
1.7.0 a while statement will only process if the statement is met, while a do ... while will always process once, then only continue if the statement is met.
1.7.0 Do ... while runs the embedded code at least once, the do command does not necessarily
1.7.0 While tests for true first before running, do ... while runs once first before checking.
1.7.0 A do ... while statement 's body always executes at least once.
1.7.1 Where as a while statement will not execute at all unless the condition for the while is true.
1.7.0 The statements within the block of the do while loop will always be executed at least once regardless of the conditions.
1.7.1 Whereas the while loops may never be executed if the conditions are not met.
1.7.0 a do ... while loop will always run through once, while an while loop performs a test before running through the loop.
1.7.0 A while statement tests the condition before it can start.
1.7.1 A do ... while statement loops through once before the condition is tested.
1.7.0 A while loop terminates at the beginning of the loop, a do or while terminates at the end of the loop.
1.7.0 the loop body always executes at least once
1.7.0 While loop evaluates its expression at the top of its loop and decides if it needs to execute, and the do-while always executes at least once and then evaluates its expression at the bottom of its loop.
1.7.0 A do ... while statement will always execute the "do" piece of code at least once before checking the condition.
1.7.1 A while statement will always check the condition first.
1.7.0 A do-while passes atleast 1 time before checking the condition, however, a while would fail to enter the loop if the condition fails in its first place.
1.7.0 a while loop checks if the condition is true or not first, if it was true, it excutes the statement. a do .. while loop executes the statement before it checks the condition. if the condition was true it would excute the statement again. so a do ... while loop would excute the statement atleast once.
1.7.0 NO ANSWER
1.7.0 A do ... while loop will always execute atleast once, a while loop may never execute depending on teh conditions.
1.7.0 a while loop is pre-check -LRB- it checks the condition statement before it executes the code within the while block -RRB- a do while loop is post-check -LRB- it checks the condition AFTER the block executes, it runs at least once no matter what the condition statement is -RRB-
1.7.0 -RRB- -RRB- What is the main difference between a while and a do ... while statement?
1.7.1 The do while construct consists of a block of code and a condition.
1.7.2 First, the code within the block is executed, and then the condition is evaluated, this is done until it is proven false.
1.7.3 The difference between the While loop is it tests the condition before the code within the block is executed.

2.2.0 A data member is part of a C plus plus class or structure that stores data of a certain type ... A local variable inside a member function is only available inside that function, and can be used to derive a desired outcome.
2.2.0 A local variable can only be accessed within the scope of its declaration.
2.2.0 Data members are the atributes of the function and can be used outside the function.
2.2.1 Local variable can not be used outside the function and the value is lost after the function terminates.

2.2.0 Local variables are used only within the scope of its declaration
2.2.0 A data member is a more general term describing all objects instantiated within a member function.
2.2.1 "Local" in local variables refers more to the scope of a variable, which may be located in anything from a control structure to a class.
2.2.2 Local variables whose scope are in a member function are the same as data members of member functions.
2.2.0 A data member exists permanently in that program 's memory as long as it is run.
2.2.1 A local variable inside a member function is temporal and only used to operate in the function and exists as long as the function is run.
2.2.0 local variables can only be used within the function, where as data members can be set to public access and can be used throughout
2.2.0 The local variable is lost once it exits the block of code, while the data member is not.

2.2.0 a Data member is encapsulated within a class or object, it is static and can be shared by all instances of that class. however local variable 's are only used from the function or block in which it is declared and not the whole class. other wise they would be called global variables.
2.3.0 A constructor initializes an object or objects of a class.
2.3.1 A function of a class performs a task such as display a line of text or do some kind of mathematical operations.
2.3.0 all constructors are functions but not all functions are constructors.
2.3.1 Also functions can have nearly infinite purposes, while constructors always create an instance of whichever class you are using.
2.3.2 You can change how a constructor does something but not what it does.
2.3.3 With functions you can change not only the how but also the what.
2.3.0 Unlike regular functions, constructors are only used to initialize an object s data when it is created.
2.3.1 Constructors must also be given the same name as the class and cannot return any values.

2.3.1 A function cannot have the same name as a class and computes data.
2.3.0 a constructor is a function that initializes a class instance, a function performs whatever task it is written for
2.3.0 A constructor cannot return values, not even void, but function get a return value.
2.3.0 a constructor cannot return values, its not even void. it is used to initialize an object 's data when it is created. whereas, a function is created to do a specific task, and it can return values.

2.3.1 A function is part of an object.
2.3.0 constructors initialize the data that is then used in the calculations of a function
2.3.0 a constructor is called when the class is created, a function can be called any time.
2.3.0 constructor is a special block of statements called when an object is created, either when it is declared statically or constructed on the stack.
2.3.1 However a function is a portion of code within a larger program, which performs a specific task and independent to the rest of the code.
2.4.0 The compiler creates a default constructor when we do not define one in our class file
2.4.0 during compilation
2.4.0 When the class does not explicitly include a constructor.
2.4.0 When no parameters are set is when a default constructor is used.

2.5.0 Just one per class.
2.5.0 As many as you want so long as they have different parameters.
2.5.0 There is no limit to the number of constructors in a class because like functions, constructors can be overloaded.
2.5.0 It depends what type of class is being defined.
2.5.1 Typically you would have a constructor call for each object.
2.5.0 In C plus plus, the constructor can be overloaded in that there can be more than one constructor for a class, each having different parameters.
2.5.0 1

2.5.0 A very large amount of constructors can be created for any given class through overloading.
2.5.1 When two constructors with a different type or number of parameters are created, they are said to be overloaded, and C plus plus can recognize which constructor to use based on the type of the variables that are passed or returned.

2.6.1 While a definition prototype requires more than one parameters to be passed in order to complete its task.
2.6.0 The FUNCTION PROTOTYPE is where the programmer declares that he or she is using a function other than main -LRB- -RRB- .
2.6.1 This is like declaring a variable, the programmer knows that he or she will be using in the future, but has yet to say where they are going to use it, or how.

3.3.0 The compiler can ignore the inline qualifier and typically does so for all but the smallest functions.
3.3.0 Placing the qualifier inline before a function 's return type in the function definition "advises" the compiler to generate a copy of the function 's code in place to avoid a function call.

3.3.0 When the compiler inline-expands a function call, the function 's code gets inserted into the caller 's code stream -LRB- conceptually similar to what happens with a define macro -RRB- .
3.3.1 This can, depending on a zillion other things, improve performance, because the optimizer can procedurally integrate the called code optimize the called code into the caller.
3.4.0 Overall the program has better performance -LRB- means it is faster -RRB- because it does not have to copy large amounts of data.
3.4.0 because you cannot change the original and passing by reference limits memory needed for the program.
3.4.0 Passing by reference can eliminate the pass-by-value overhead of copying large amounts of data.
3.4.0 It is often more efficient to pass references, rather than large objects, to functions.
3.4.1 This allows the compiler to pass the address of the object while maintaining the syntax that would have been used to access the object.
3.4.0 Pass by reference is good for performance reasons, because it can eliminate the pass by value overhead of copying large amounts of data.
3.4.0 You do not alter the original value of the variable that was passed.
3.4.0 Do not have to make copies of stuff.
3.4.0 you do not use unessesary memory space to copy variables between functions

3.4.0 Gives called function the ability to access and modify the caller s argument data.
3.4.0 Gives called function the ability to access and modify the caller s argument data directly.
3.4.0 It is more efficient and it changes the variable not online inside the function but outside so that the new value can be used elsewhere.
3.4.0 you do not make another copy and waste memory
3.4.0 Passing by reference eliminates the copying of large amounts of data, typical with pass by value.
3.4.0 If a function 's arguments are large in size, computing time and memory space is not wasted copying down the argument and passing it to the function.
3.4.1 Also pass by reference gives the function called the permission to read edit the argument directly.
3.4.0 Gives access to the caller data directly, also it allows for modifying the data.
3.4.0 less overhead overall, and you modify the variable directly.
3.4.0 The original variable being referenced can be modified directly by the called function.
3.4.0 gives function ability to access and modify the caller 's argument data directly
3.4.0 Gives the called function the ability to access and modify the caller 's argument data directly.
3.4.0 Less overhead than passed by value, especially when using large numbers.
3.4.0 large data items can be passed without copying the entire data point, reducing execution time and the amout of memory space needed
3.4.0 The data can be modified directly instead of making a copy of the data.
3.4.1 Improves execution time with large amounts of data.
3.4.0 Functions can directly modify arguments that are passed by reference.
3.4.0 It gives access and modify the caller 's argument data directly.
3.4.1 It eliminate the pass by value overhead of copying large amounts ofdata
3.4.0 it takes less memory, thus it would make the program faster
3.4.0 You are able to modify the variable that is referenced directly.
3.4.0 if you pass by reference, you can modify the value as opposed to passing by value where you cannot change the value
3.4.0 only the memory address is sent to the function, so no copy of the object sent needs to be made.
3.4.1 It makes the function run faster, and saves memory.
3.4.0 Actual arguments are associated with dummy arguments when a function or subroutine is referenced.
3.4.1 In a procedure reference, the actual argument list identifies the correspondence between the actual arguments provided in the list and the dummy arguments of the subprogram
3.5.0 The compiler selects the proper functions to execute based on number, types and order of arguments in the function call.
3.5.0 They differentiated by the compiler by the conditions or inputs used for one of the overloaded functions.
3.5.0 The compiler distinguishes overloaded functions by their signatures.
3.5.1 It encodes each function identifier with the number and types of its parameters to generate type-safe linkage, which ensures the proper overloaded function is called.

3.5.1 Overloading the concept of providing different meaning to a object based on the context of its presence.
3.5.2 Overloading is one type of polymorphism and this is also a feature in programing.

3.7.0 not answered
3.7.0 anything you can do recursively you can do iteratively
3.7.0 Many problems can be solved by both iteration and recursion, and either may go into a condition of infinite execution if a termination test is omitted.
3.7.0 Iteration and recursion both use repetition and perform several simple operations and algorithms successively until they reach a certain limit.
3.7.1 So both involve a termination test to find that limit and both slowly approach that termination limit.
3.7.2 Both are based on a control statement as well.
3.7.3 If coded poorly, both can continue on for forever until the compiler or the computer either locks up, shuts down or halts the operation.

3.7.0 they both are able to do repetiive tasks. however recurisve calls itself with different parameters and defines and exit clause that is guaranteeed to be reached.
3.7.1 Iterative includes a loop which iterates a pre-determined number of times, or checks for an exit clause every time through
4.1.0 int n [10]; or or array of 10 integers and int n [arraySize] or or where arraySize is some positive integer defined by the user
4.1.0 by either inputing the different elements in the array at coding or giving the array specifacations as to the size of the array. it is also possible when giving it specifacations to tell the array to grow as needed.
4.1.0 You can initialize and array by using an initializer list in its declaration or by initializing its size with a constant variable.
4.1.0 Pass the length along with the array or use a vector.
4.1.0 One way is to declare a size of the array using a variable that is equal to an integer.
4.1.1 The other way, if the size is omitted in the declaration, the compiler determines the size of the array based on the size of the initializer list.
4.1.0 In the declaration -LRB- int array [x] -RRB- or with an initilizer -LRB- int array [] equals 0,1,2, etc.
4.1.0 1. Declare the length of the array -LRB- int array [10]; -RRB-
4.1.1 2. Initialize the array -LRB- int array [] equals 0, 1, 2, 3; or or compiler will assume size of 4 -RRB-
4.1.0 statically and dynamically
4.1.0 Explicitly int array [10]; or by variable const int size equals 10; int array [size];
4.1.0 Array lengths can be explicitly specified by inputing the number of elements between the brackets [] during declaration, or implicitly by including an initializer list WITHOUT specifying a number between [], the compiler will automatically declare the array with the proper number of elements needed for the list.
4.1.0 Specify an array s size with a constant variable.
4.1.1 And setting array elements with calculations.
4.1.0 statically, using and dynamically, using []
4.1.0 define it as array [5] or array [1,2,3,4,5]
4.1.0 Static and dynamic.
4.1.0 manually inside the brackets or automatically via an initializer list
4.1.0 You can use an initializer list, or simply tell the compiler how many elements you want in the array.
4.1.1 For an Initializer list: int a [] equals 10, 2, 3, 4, 5;
4.1.2 For an elemental declaration: int b [5];
4.1.3 Both arrays have 5 elements in them, but array a is already initialized.
4.1.0 In a string you can specify with the strlen -LRB- arrayname -RRB- command.
4.1.1 This gets the length of the string.
4.1.2 Another way is with integers where you initiate the size from the start, ex array [40] specifying a possible length of up to 40. Then it is passed by an object the actual ammout in the array.
4.1.3 Another way is to declare it in an initializing program.
4.1.0 Implicit, namely when you give it values, like 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, at which the compiler will automatically give this a size.
4.1.1 Static, during the declaration.
4.1.0 Supply an integer inside the brackets or the compiler counts the number of elements in the initializer list. int n [5]; int n [] equals 1,2,3,4,5
4.1.0 either initializing the array with a specific length or initializing an array while declaring its contents.
4.1.0 within the brackets or by using an initializer list.
4.1.0 specify the number of elements in the array declaration with a constant or using a constant variable for future scalability
4.1.0 with a number and with a variable
4.1.0 explicitly, by declaring it in brackets -LRB- i. e. int array [50]; -RRB- and implicitly, by initializing several values -LRB- i. e. int array [] equals 1, 2, 3; -RRB-
4.1.0 one way of specifying of array is A [10]; other way of specifying array is a [arraysize] equals [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
4.1.0 1-Initializing an array in a declaration with an initializer list
4.1.1 2-Specifying an array s size with a constant variable
4.1.0 Initializing the size in the brackets: int a [100];
4.1.1 Initializing the length by assigning variables: int a [] equals 1,2,3;
4.1.0 user defined value or by the number of elements in initializer list
4.1.0 you can assign the size of it inside the brackets when you declare the array [3], or you can have it set by how many items you set the array equal to 1,2,3
4.1.0 use an arraylist, or have your program ask the array how many elements it has.
4.1.1 As an obj it it should have member length that is the number of slots it has.
4.2.0 strings that are used in an char array are much easier to manipulate than as a string object, because each character is stored separately rather than as a whole
4.2.0 the type string uses less storage and you have to change the string all at once. with an array of characters you can make permutations of words using the characters stored in the array, without needing to actually access and change the variables. with an array of characters you can just change how they are accessed.
4.2.0 Unlike in a string declared using type string, in a string declared using an array of characters the programmer must provide the null terminating character and must ensure the array is large enough to hold the string and null terminating character.
4.2.0 All strings represented by character arrays end with the null character.
4.2.1 You declare an object of type string just like any other type, for example: string s;
4.2.0 By using an array of characters, one can store and manipulate the strings rather than just having a type string variable.
4.2.0 type string is an array of chars that will make an array of single letter characters while an array of strings will be an actual array of words -LRB- or an array of char arrays -RRB-
4.2.0 They are basically the same, however, a string ends with a null character, denoting the end of the string -LRB- and the size -RRB- .
4.2.1 A char array has potential to be any size, so it must be declared or limited.
4.2.0 string is a class in the standard library and has method that modify it.
4.2.1 Whereas the char array is on able to be modifie by the user.
4.2.0 By using an array of characters, you are limited to the size of the array of characters.
4.2.1 By declaring by type the end of the string is acknowledged by white space.
4.2.0 The data class type string are designed to handle character data, and has many functions built into the class library to deal with them.
4.2.1 An array of characters however is subject to all the same rules of any other array with no real additional functionality.
4.2.2 Another difference is that the string class deals with the null character implicitly, unlike an array of characters, which must handle the null character explicitly.
4.2.0 string declared used in an array of characters contains each character in the array and a special string-termination character called the null character versus the type string.
4.2.0 A char array reads a string as each individual character.
4.2.1 A string literal array reads the entire string.
4.2.0 array of characters can only hold as many characters as the array size and strings are not that limited.
4.2.0 Stings can only be modified by functions of the String class, an array of characters can be modified by the user
4.2.0 if by type string, the array contains an additional terminating null character
4.2.0 The array of characters has a null character 0 at the end of the array to signify the array 's end.
4.2.1 The string does not have this.
4.2.0 strings with type string are just that.
4.2.1 Strings.
4.2.2 They are not part of an array list at all where as one declared by an array is actually an array of characters able to be pointed and detected.
4.2.0 the array of characters has a set length, while the type string has virtually unlimited length.
4.2.0 Char array Individual letters can be accessed directly with array subscript notation.
4.2.1 String array array subscript will return the entire string.
4.2.0 array of characters need a termination character as well as size specification whether its explicit or implicit.
4.2.0 when using an array individual characters can be accessed and manipulated.
4.2.0 strings declared using an array of characters could result in data loss if character array not initialized large enough.
4.2.0 an array is passed by reference therefore if an array of characters is changed, the memory is changed not just the variable
4.2.0 the type string has several built-in functions not available when using a char array, but the individual characters in an array or more directly accessible than the characters in a string type string.
4.2.0 declaring a string, it includes white spaces but declaring a array of character does not include white spaces
4.2.0 an array of characters has one element a string doesnt have. it is the termination element, or "null"
4.2.0 Strings declared using the type string can vary in length.
4.2.1 Strings declared using an array of characters can not extend past the array length.
4.2.0 cant modify individual characters of a type string array, character type array can modify individual characters
4.2.0 the type string is a class and is safer, while the other is just an array of characters.
4.2.0 array it is the collection of similar data types ex: int a [10] ten indicates the size of array.
4.2.1 [] is index of array, we can give only integer values to array of a. where as string mean collection of group of characters. string declarations have a datatype usually causes storage to be allocated in memory that is capable of holding some predetermined number of symbols.
4.2.2 However Arrays can be declared to contain values of any non reference data type.
4.2.3 Multiple arrarys of the same type
4.3.0 by reference only
4.3.0 a reference pointer to an element in the array.
4.3.0 Arrays are passed to functions by reference.
4.3.0 Arrays are passed by reference
4.3.1 Individual array elements passed by value
4.3.2 Functions that take arrays as arguments
4.3.3 Function prototypes may include parameter names const array parameters
4.3.0 Arrays are passed by reference.
4.3.0 you must pass the array and its size to the function.
4.3.1 Ex. function -LRB- array, size -RRB- ;
4.3.0 Usually the same way you pass anything else ... you do not have to specify the length of a char array, just pass it to the function by sending the name of the array.
4.3.1 Example: char str [20]; isPalindrome -LRB- str -RRB- ; or or this sends the char array to the function isPalindrome.
4.3.2 Otherwise, would need to send the length of the array as well.
4.3.0 you pass a pointer to the first item and also pass the size.
4.3.0 By reference.
4.3.0 In two parts, the array itself, and it is size, so that the function it is being passed to can avoid out of bounds errors.
4.3.0 Specify array name without brackets.
4.3.1 Array size is normally passed as another argument so the function can process the specific number of elements in the array.
4.3.2 Arrays are passed by reference.
4.3.3 Individual array elements passed by value.
4.3.4 Functions that take arrays as arguments.
4.3.0 Arrays are passed by reference.
4.3.0 the same way but with [] at the declaration and the actual function.
4.3.0 specify the array name without brackets.
4.3.0 by reference
4.3.0 You pass the name of the array to the function.
4.3.1 So for: int bin [10]; you pass it to an array like so: jingle -LRB- bin -RRB- ; but jingle must be declared correctly in order to receive an array, either with prototype void jingle -LRB- int [] -RRB- ; or with the definition in its initialization: void jingle -LRB- int array [] -RRB- ;
4.3.2 It is also worth noting that arrays are passed to function by reference, so as to not copy large arrays over and over and burn memory.
4.3.3 This gives the function complete control over the array however.
4.3.0 They are called by the function then the function must loop through the array to get the set of characters.
4.3.0 by reference by default, unless you specify const, at which the later will make the array unmodifiable.
4.3.0 The function recieves both the array and the array size as parameters. function -LRB- arrayName, arraySize -RRB-
4.3.0 specifying array name and passing as reference in an argument into the function
4.3.0 1st you must specify the array name without brackets and then the array name and size are passed as two arguments in the function call.
4.3.0 arrays are passed by reference, passing the starting address of array. programmer specifies the array name without brackets and passes the array size as another argument so the function can process the specific number of elements in the array
4.3.0 by reference only
4.3.0 by reference
4.3.0 by reference
4.3.0 by refrence
4.3.0 function -LRB- int [], int length -RRB-
4.3.0 by reference
4.3.0 by reference
4.3.0 The function reads the variables, stores them. then returns the what ever the variable reads.
4.3.1 The function then prints the content of the array.
4.4.0 a static array will store the new values that were assigned to each of its elements. meaning if you call a function twice it will use the last values that were returned the first time. if you do not declare it static then the new values will not be stored and will be reset to their original value
4.4.0 a static array can only be referenced not accessed.
4.4.1 Also static arrays can be used without creating an object.
4.4.0 An array declared as static is not created and and initialized each time the function and it is also not destroyed when the function terminates.
4.4.0 A program intializes static local arrays when their declarations are first encountered.
4.4.1 If a static array is not initialized explicityly by the programmer, earch element of that array is intialized to zero by the compiler when the array is created.
4.4.2 Non-static array members cannot be initialized at all in C plus plus.
4.4.0 Arrays that are static remain the same size throughout the program execution.
4.4.0 a static array will only be initilized once, a non static array will be re-initilized once the program reaches the initilization line again.
4.4.0 An array declared as static is available from beginning of program to end.
4.4.1 One with o static declaration disappears if it is not accessed within the right scope.
4.4.0 a static array has pre-runtime size and that size cannot be changed.
4.4.1 A dynamic array gets its size at runtime.
4.4.0 If an array is declared as static, it is not created each time the array is called.
4.4.0 An array that is not declared as static will re-initialize every time the function declaring it is called.
4.4.1 A static array will initialize only once, at the declaration, and will store the values in it is elements throughout the duration of the program, even if the same function is called multiple times, a static array will only initialize once.
4.4.0 All elements are initialized to zero if not explicitly initialized, this does not happen for automatic local arrays
4.4.0 All elements are initialized to zero if not explicitly initialized for a static array, while a non-static array is not initialized to zero.
4.4.0 static cannot be changed
4.4.0 A static array has a set size that cannot change.
4.4.1 The data may not need all of the space assigned, or could go beyond the size.
4.4.0 A static member prevents naming conflicts -LRB- not put into global namespace -RRB- while allowing for information hiding -LRB- private, public -RRB- .
4.4.0 A static local array exists for the duration of the program and its elements are initialized to 0 if not explicitly initialized.
4.4.1 So a static local array 's elements will still be the same when called later unless specifically initialized to something else.
4.4.2 This does not happen for automatic arrays.
4.4.0 Static arrays are those with a declared size, that is known to the program, whereas non-static arrays leave the size undeclared and open so it can be assigned later.
4.4.1 Usually used for input purposes.
4.4.0 static arrays keep the values after the end of a function, while non static reinitialize every time.
4.4.0 Static arrays are created and initialized only once, and the values are not destroyed when the function terminates in the program.
4.4.1 Automatic arrays reset everytime the function is called.
4.4.0 its not created and initialized each time program calls the function, and is not destroyed every time the function ends in the program.
4.4.0 When we declare it static the array is not destroyed after the function is over.
4.4.1 When an array is not declared as static, the array is created and initialized every time a function calls it.
4.4.0 the static array exists for the duration of the program
4.4.0 an array declared as static can only be declared once
4.4.0 A static array exists in memory until the program terminates, whereas an automatic -LRB- or normal -RRB- array is removed when the function that created it terminates
4.4.0 not answered
4.4.0 Only constants can be used to declare the size of automatic and static arrays
4.4.1 Exists for the duration of the program
4.4.2 Is initialized when its declaration is first encountered
4.4.3 All elements are initialized to zero if not explicitly initialized
4.4.0 A static array cannot be changed in the program.
4.4.0 static arrays are available throughout the program
4.4.0 a static array is allocated when the program starts and is freed when the program exits but has limited scope, while an array that is not declared static is allocated and freed when it comes into and out of scope.
4.4.0 if they are declared fixed or static that means they cannot change size once their storage has been allocated, however one that is not or dynamic arrarys can be resized.
4.5.0 at least 2, depending on how many arrays are being used.
4.5.0 all of them.
4.5.0 When passing a multi-dimensional array, all dimensions must be specified except for the first dimension.
4.5.0 It depends what parameters you are passing in a multidimensional.
4.5.1 A multideminsional can have more than two dimensions.
4.5.0 The first dimension is not required however the subsequent dimension -LRB- s -RRB- are needed for the compiler.
4.5.0 all but the first
4.5.0 All of the dimensions must be specified.
4.5.0 just the first one at least.
4.5.0 Two paramaters, the array and how many columns. array -LRB- a [], [3] -RRB-
4.5.0 The size of the first dimension can be omitted, same as a regular array.
4.5.1 However, for every dimension outside the first, the size of those dimensions must be specified when passed, for example, a multi-dimensional array of [2] [4] [6] with the name MultiArray would be passed as: "MultiArray [] [4] [6], 2"
4.5.0 Size of subsequent dimensions are required.
4.5.1 Compiler must know how many elements to skip to move to the second element in the first dimension
4.5.0 Every dimension after the first.
4.5.0 both
4.5.0 the size of the first dimension does not need to be specified, but all other dimensions do.
4.5.0 when passing -LRB- in main -RRB- a multidimensional array to a function, no dimensions need be specified
4.5.0 All dimensions except for the first one need to be specified when passing an array to a function, the compiler needs to know how many memory addresses to skip to make it back to the 2nd element in the first dimension.
4.5.1 The size of the first dimension does not need to be specified.
4.5.0 as many as there are dimensions.
4.5.1 Most commonly just rows and columns
4.5.0 at least 2, but it should always equal the number of dimensions that the argument is expecting ... like ... blah [] [] [] [] will require 4 dimensional array input. blah [] [] [] will require a 3 dimensional array. blah [] [] will require a 2 dimensional array.
4.5.0 None, just pass the array name.
4.5.0 all subsequent dimensions after the first dimension. first is not needed to be specified.
4.5.0 all dimensions, excluding the first one.
4.5.0 all dimensions but the first
4.5.0 the first needs to be specified by size and the rest need only be stated -LRB- first like this [3] then [] [] [] -RRB-
4.5.0 one less than the number of dimensions the array contains
4.5.0 not answered
4.5.0 one
4.5.0 All subsequent dimensions after the first one.
4.5.0 two or more
4.5.0 1 less than the total number of dimensions

4.6.0 it is a run-time error
4.7.0 usually it is by rows then followed by the column, but it is up to the programmer to determine how values are stored in bi-dimensional arrays.
4.7.0 by rows.
4.7.0 Multi-dimensional arrays are stored in memory by rows.
4.7.0 A bi-dimensional or two-dimensional array is stored in a row-column matrix.
4.7.1 Where the first index indicates the row and the second indicates the column.
4.7.2 This means that when array elements are accessed in the order in which they are actually stored in memory, the right index changes faster than the left.
4.7.0 They are stored in memory in rows.
4.7.0 rows
4.7.0 By rows.
4.7.0 by rows
4.7.0 m-by-n. by row-column.
4.7.0 bi-dimensional arrays are stored by rows
4.7.0 By rows.
4.7.0 By column.
4.7.0 columns
4.7.0 By rows
4.7.0 by-dimensional arrays are stored by row
4.7.0 x by y is row by column.
4.7.1 So x is rows, and y is columns.
4.7.2 Since the length of the row is not needed when passing the array to the function, this leads me to believe that bi-dimensional arrays are stored by rows at a time.
4.7.0 Both, they are stored in seperate sections.
4.7.0 by rows, then columns.
4.7.0 Rows

5.1.0 Takes an element of an array and compares it with the next element, depending on the values of the two elements they will switch and then the program will compare the new switched element with the next one in the array.
5.1.0 Insertion sort divides the list into sorted and unsorted regions, then takes each item from the unsorted region and inserts it into its correct order in the sorted region.
5.1.0 The sorted array or list is built one entry at a time.
5.1.0 It starts with the second element and checks it to see if it is less than the element -LRB- s -RRB- to the left of it and if it is it inserts it into its corrected position.
5.1.0 Compare two numbers at a time and swap until the entire list is sorted.
5.1.0 Assume the first number is sorted, then move down the list and "insert" the numbers you come across into the corresponding place on the sorted side of the list.
5.1.0 insertion sort is were after k iterations the first k items in the array are sorted it take the k plus 1 item and inserts it into the correct position in the already sorted k elements.

5.1.0 have a marker and sort everything to the left of the value for every new value when moving to the right.
5.1.0 The main idea behind insertion sort is to take a random variable from the right and insert it in order to the left.
5.1.0 Insertion sort progresses through a list of elements and determines where the next element should be inserted into an already sorted array starting with sorting and using the first two elements.
5.1.0 it goes through the list only once, picking each integer and putting it in its desired position, then continuing.

5.1.0 Insert the item into its proper position by shifting larger sorted array values to the right.
5.1.0 a comparison sort in which the sorted array is built one entry at a time
5.1.0 Insertion sort is an algorithm where the first element of the array is in the sorted list, all the other pick one by one and taken from the unsorted array, to the sorted array.
5.1.0 Every iteration of an insertion sort takes away an element from the input data, inserting it at the right position in the sorted list.
5.1.0 the insertion sort creates a new array and inserts each item in its place with respect to the new array.
5.1.0 Insertion sort takes each entitity of an unsorted array in order, and sorts it into the correct position between the entities it has sorted.
5.1.0 it takes the second element and swaps it with the 1st if it is less and keeps it there if its larger, then it goes to the third element and inserts it in the right places with respect to the first 2 elements and so on ...
5.1.0 Starting with the first element in the array, each following element is put in place by determining if it is smaller or larger than the starting element.
5.1.0 one by one, each item is taken and placed into the correct place in the sorted portion of the array until there are no more items
5.1.0 you take each element and insert it in the correct position with respect to all the elements before it
5.1.0 Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm, a comparison sort in which the sorted array -LRB- or list -RRB- is built one entry at a time.
5.2.0 Searches an array for the largest or the smallest element and is moved out to the front of the array then it will search for the next largest or the smallest element to move out to the front
5.2.0 Selection sort searches the whole array for the largest item and puts it at the end of the array, then searches for the second largest item and puts it at the second to last spot and so on.
5.2.0 Finds the minimum value and swap it with the value in the first position.
5.2.0 It finds the minimum element in the array and swaps it with the first element then repeats this step swapping the minimum element with nth positions in the array.
5.2.0 Find the lowest value and place it at the front, then find the next lowest and place it in front of the last value, etc.
5.2.0 Cycle through the unsorted list, place the minimum in the next slot in the sorted list, and repeat.
5.2.0 find the minimum value in the list swap it with the first element in the list the find the second largest and swap it with the second element in the array continue like this until the array is sorted.
5.2.0 Find the smallest and put it in the current position till you get to the end.
5.2.0 Find the lowest unsorted value in the array and place it at the current position -LRB- starting at the first element in the array -RRB- and advance the "current" position by one.

5.2.0 Find the lowest value and place it in the front of the list and swap it with that value.
5.2.1 Continue moving right.
5.2.0 The main idea behind selection sort is to take the least variable from the right and put it directly to the left.
5.2.0 Find the smallest value in the list and make it the first element, then find the smallest value of the leftover list and make it the first element of the leftover list and continue until the list is sorted.
5.2.0 It runs through and finds the lowest -LRB- or highest -RRB- value and puts it in its desired position.
5.2.0 Places the smallest item in the list at position 1, and then proceeds to each value until the last position of the ray is reached.
5.2.0 Search for the largest item in an array and swap it with the last unsorted item.
5.2.0 finds the smallest element and places in 1st position. then the process is repeated on the rest of the array.

5.3.0 The run time for this sorting program is n to the power of 2. Best case is the list is already sorted, worst case is the list is sorted but in reverse.
5.3.0 Insertion sort is O -LRB- n -RRB- and performs n minus 1 operations in the best-case scenario, which is when the list or array is already sorted.
5.3.0 The number of operations for insertions sort, under best-case, is n -LRB- n minus 1 -RRB- divided by 2. The best case for insertion sort is on a sorted list where it runs is O -LRB- n -RRB- .
5.3.0 Best case would be O -LRB- n -RRB- or n minus 1, because that is what it takes to scan the array and make one swap.
5.3.1 The array would then be sorted and would take only 1 operation.
5.3.0 Best case-1
5.3.1 Worst Case-N
5.3.0 It will do -LRB- n -RRB- operations where -LRB- n -RRB- is the number of elements in the array.
5.3.1 Best case is when all the elements are already sorted.
5.3.0 O -LRB- n -RRB-
5.3.0 Best case is all elements sorted. n minus 1.
5.3.0 The best case scenario for an insertion sort, where all the elements of the array have been already sorted, will cause the for loop to iterate "x" times -LRB- "x" being the number of elements in the array -RRB- and the while loop to never have to iterate, resulting in the insertion sort to require "x" operations.
5.3.0 1 operation. the best case scenario s where it is already sorted and does one comparision.
5.3.0 n operations, where n is the number of items.
5.3.0 n minus 1
5.3.0 O -LRB- n -RRB- , the list is already sorted.
5.3.0 Insertion sort will take n minus 1 operations if the array is in reverse order.

5.3.0 O -LRB- n -RRB-
5.3.0 N number of times.
5.3.1 Where N equals the number of elements in the list.
5.3.2 Best-case scenario is that the elements in the list are already sorted.
5.3.0 the best case scenario for insertion sort is a list that is already sorted. the number of operations would be the same as the number of elements
5.3.0 insertion sort will make zero operations -LRB- and length 1 comparisons -RRB- in the best case scenario, that is, when the array its given is already in order.
5.3.0 theta -LRB- n -RRB- the best case senario is that everything is already sorted
5.3.0 n operations
5.3.1 The best case scenario is when all the numbers are in increasing order.
5.3.0 it could be considered that having only one item would be the easiest to sort, but this could also be a trivial result as nothing is moved having two items allows the algorithm to sort the items into the correct order
5.3.0 the best case is if it only has to look through the list once.
5.3.1 The best case scenario is when it goes through the list and does not have to make any changes -LRB- the list is already sorted -RRB-
5.3.0 very simplistic it moves one element from the list by one and inserting them in their correct position into a new slot then starting over. best case is -LRB- 0 -RRB- 1
5.4.0 The base case for a recursive merge sort is one number.
5.4.1 One number by itself is a sorted list, regardless of what number it is.
5.4.0 The base case for a recursive implementation of merge sort is when the sequence being passed to merge sort has less than 2 elements.
5.4.0 The base case for a recursive implementation of merge sort is one.
5.4.0 The best case is the same as the worst case O -LRB- n log n -RRB- for a recursive merge sort.
5.4.0 there is one object in the split array to sort.
5.4.0 The base case is when the length of the current array is 1.
5.4.0 O -LRB- nlog -LRB- n -RRB- -RRB-
5.4.0 Best case is one element.
5.4.1 One element is sorted.
5.4.0 If the array being sorted has 0 or 1 elements
5.4.0 T -LRB- n -RRB- equals 0, if n is less than 2.

7.6.0 each node points to both its predecessor and its successor.
7.6.0 a doubly linked list has pointers in both directions. this allows for access from back to front as well as front to back
7.6.0 A doubly linked list can be traversed either direction, while a normal linked list can only be traversed from start to finish
7.6.0 Double Linked list are often easier to manipulate, because they allow sequential access to the list in both direction
7.6.0 given a node in the list, one can navigate easily in either direction
7.6.0 You can traverse the list both forward and backwards.
7.6.0 a doubly linked list allows you to back up from a node rather than having to go through the entire list again
7.6.0 Gives faster times for some operations such as insertion and deletion
7.6.0 The primary disadvantage of doubly linked lists are that -LRB- 1 -RRB- each node requires an extra pointer, requiring more space, and -LRB- 2 -RRB- the insertion or deletion of a node takes a bit longer -LRB- more pointer operations -RRB- .
7.7.0 they take up twice as much memory for each node

7.7.0 Double-linked lists require more space per node, and their elementary operations are more expensive
7.7.0 More difficult to delete and create nodes.
7.7.0 They use more memory and you have to make 2 pointers and update 2 pointers each time you change the list.
7.7.0 nodes take up more memory
7.7.0 Each node requires an extra pointer -LRB- space requirements increased -RRB- , Insertion or deletion of a node takes a longer -LRB- more pointer operations -RRB- .
7.7.0 its a little more confusing.
7.7.1 The special cases at the end and beginning become more difficult to do.
7.7.0 increased actions to add and remove elements to the linked list.
7.7.0 Inserting and deleting in a double-linked list is more involved, and has special cases at the beginning and end.
7.7.0 The main disadvanate is that if hard to remove all items in the list.
7.7.0 each node requires an extra pointer, taking up more storage. insertions and deletions require more pointer operations.
7.7.0 in a doubly linked list there are twice as many pointers for each element, therefore more memory is used
7.7.0 The process of adding and removing Nodes in a Doubly linked list is more complex than in a basic linked list
7.7.0 Double linked lists require more space per node, and their elementary operation are more expensive
7.7.0 1-each node requires an extra pointer, requiring more space
7.7.1 2-the insertion or deletion of a node takes a bit longer, more pointer operations
7.7.0 It takes up twice the storage needed.
7.7.0 using more pointers to enable the backward movement takes up more memory, having more pointers make it slightly more work to add or remove a node from the list
7.7.0 increased memory requirements, slightly more complicated when modifying elements in the list

8.3.0 by having a max number of elements, allocating an array with that number of elements, storing the elements starting at 0, and keeping track of how many elements are currently in the list
8.3.0 Stack usually holds a bunch of items with the same type, therefore u can use an array, to hold the content of the stack and an integer top that holds the index of the element at the top of the stack. u Choose an array size.
8.3.1 Then the sequence of operations used. u have to decide what data types are needed for this stack data structure.
8.4.0 You can add an element to the end of the linked list and update a pointer called top each time you modify the list.
8.4.0 You implement a list in which the head pointer points to the element most recently pushed onto the list and the pop function changes the head pointer to point to the next to last element in the list and removes the element head pointer previously pointed to.
8.4.0 This is the implementation of the stack using single linked list.
8.4.1 The operations performed on a stack are
8.4.2 1 -RRB- push -LRB- -RRB- : This is the function which is for insertion -LRB- pushing -RRB- of an element into stack
8.4.3 It is similar to the insertion of an element at the end of a single linked list see the function insert end -LRB- -RRB- in the program for operations of single linked list
8.4.4 2 -RRB- pop -LRB- -RRB- : This is the function which is for deletion -LRB- popping up -RRB- of an element from the stack

8.4.0 Using nodes to keep track of the head of the stack.
8.4.1 Then using Push -LRB- -RRB- and Pop -LRB- -RRB- to create the stack as needed.
8.4.0 Use the head as the top of the stack, only modify the head when you push or pop ... push would add a new item to the head, pop would remove the item from the head.
8.4.0 you implement a stack with a list by changing the pointer to the first element of the list to the new item and move the pointer from the top of the stack to the next item when removing an item.
8.4.0 You dynamicly create space as the stack grows.
8.4.1 The stack can be as long as you need.
8.4.0 Declare a pointer that points to the head of the linked list, only add and remove nodes from the beginning of the list.
8.4.0 Creating a linked list.
8.4.1 Add an element to the top of the stack when pushing and deleting an element when popping.
8.4.0 A singly-linked list is already a lot like a stack, it just depends on the way you address moving the head.
8.4.0 make a list, make the bottom the head, add on the end and make the end top
8.4.0 use the add function with a list as the beginning of the stack and remove for pop
8.4.0 Use head as the top and push and pop nodes from the head.

8.4.2 Push the stack to remove items, unless the stack is empty.
8.4.3 The top item is at the head of the list.
8.4.4 The last item is at the end.
8.4.0 adding the element to the end of the list so that it links to the element before it. when popping the element it takes the last element in the list and sets the previous one as the end of the list.
8.4.0 You can implement a stack using arrays or and linked list.
8.4.1 By the use of pointers, that point element -LRB- node -RRB- to the next element in the stack.
8.4.2 By the use of pointers, the stack becomes a linked list.
8.4.0 Elements are only inserted and removed from the head of the list.
8.4.1 There is no header node or current pointer.
8.4.0 use a linked list and keep track of a pointer that points to the first item
8.4.0 A singly linked list can already be easily used for LIFO data storage.
8.4.1 Members of a stack can simply be pushed and popped from a list, the first item in will be the last out.
8.4.0 using pointer
8.4.0 the top is the first pointer.
8.4.0 Keep a pointer pointing to the last element entered at the front of the array and move the pointer "back" when you delete an element.
8.4.0 using linked list, you are pushing the node that contains each int to the stack until you get to the end of your linked list
8.4.0 have a linked list, and for each push, add an item onto beginning of the list, and for each pop remove the first element in the list.
8.4.0 Using a linked list is one way to implement a stack so that it can handle essentially any number of elements.
8.4.1 It is usually convenient to put a data structure in its own module, thus, you will want to create files stack. h and a stack. c
8.5.0 List based is preferred because it is not constrained to a fix size.
8.5.1 The down fall is that it takes up more memory because each node has at least two parts, the item and the pointer.
8.5.0 List based is preferred because the stack you create is not limited in size and can increase or decrease in size as needed.
8.5.0 Array-based prevents the push operation from adding an item to the stack if the stack 's size limit, which is the size of the array, has been reached.
8.5.1 List-base much simpler to write and does not have a fixed size.
8.5.0 Array based because they are faster, easier to keep track of and less complexity in code.
8.5.0 list-based because it does not use a fixed size like an array would.
8.5.0 usually linked list because it does not have a fixed size.
8.5.1 But if you know or want to set a max size array is better.
8.5.0 List-based.
8.5.1 Allows more flexablity with size of the stack.
8.5.0 Linked lists are preferred for implementing stacks because they are not limited to a set number of elements.
8.5.0 The list-based implementation is preferred since the big O -LRB- 1 -RRB- is very efficient.
8.5.0 Linked list implementation is preferred.
8.5.1 That way, the list can be moved along without iteration.
8.5.0 list because it its size is not determined
8.5.0 Linked list because it takes up less memory and is scalable
8.5.0 List-based, as the list can be grown dynamically, and as the head node is easily accessible.
8.5.0 list based because the nodes are easier to work with and can be traversed easier
8.5.0 list based, because of the lower processing overhead and nearly unlimited space, due to linked list design.
8.5.0 list-based
8.5.1 It can grow and shrink dynamically, unlike the fixed size array.
8.5.0 list based because arrays can become full, lists can grow or shrink as needed
8.5.0 List-bases implentation is preferred.
8.5.1 One of the main reasons is because of that the list has no fixed size.
8.5.0 Array is preferred.
8.5.1 Linked list implementation requires extra space to store pointers.
8.5.2 Space is allocated dynamically in the list-based which takes more time.
8.5.0 link list is preferred because it makes pushing elements easier because there is no limit other than memory to the number of elements
8.5.0 List-based implementation is much easier to implement, and allows the stack to scale as necessary.
8.5.1 It is therefore the preferred implementation.
8.5.0 Array based implementation requires less memory than a list based. inceasing the size of a resizeable array can waste storage and time
8.5.0 in an array based stack you would need to pre-determine a size, where in a list you can increase or decrease the size however you want.
8.5.0 A list-based implementation is preferred because the list is more flexible than a array.
8.5.0 i would think a list based would be better because you can change the pointers of the nodes to add or remove things from your stack
8.5.0 list based, because it is much more flexible, easier to use, and doesnt need to have a max size defined when it is made.
8.5.0 array based list is preferred because it can hold any size as long as u specify it.
8.6.0 They are converted to post fix expressions.
8.6.1 It still follow the order of precedence for the operators.
8.6.0 They are first converted to postfix expressions and then evaluated.
8.6.0 Computers cannot evaulate infix expressions, it must first convert infix to postfix expression then it can evaluate.
8.6.0 By using parentheses to have order in the expression.
8.6.0 In postfix notation.
8.6.0 computers usually convert infix expressions to post fix expression and evaluate them using a stack.
8.6.0 they are converted to postfix
8.6.0 Infix expressions are interpreted as postfix expressions by implementing stacks.
8.6.0 They are first converted into an equivalent postfix expression so it can be read by the computer.
8.6.0 The computer translates the infix expression to a postfix expression, then solves.
8.6.0 in postfix format
8.6.0 they use parenthisis and a stack to determine which evaluations need to be made first
8.6.0 By throwing variables into a postfix expression and operands onto a parentheses regulated stack until end parentheses and enough variables to operate on are encountered.
8.6.0 by being passed to the function by a leading term
8.6.0 i have an hard time explaining this so i will show how infix is evaluated instead.
8.6.1 Start with an infix expression, like, -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- 5 plus 2 -RRB- multiplied by 5 -RRB- plus -LRB- 400 divided by -LRB- 2 plus 3 -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- , and push items until you get a " -RRB- " and once that happens, perform the operations until you reach an "
8.6.2 -LRB- "
8.6.3 ... with that complete, you will now have
8.6.4 -LRB- -LRB- 7 multiplied by 5 -RRB- plus -LRB- 400 divided by -LRB- 2 plus 3 -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- as now the expression that will be evaluated ... perform last step again ...
8.6.5 -LRB- 35 plus -LRB- 400 divided by -LRB- 2 plus 3 -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- is now the stack ... repeat agian ...
8.6.6 -LRB- 35 plus -LRB- 400 divided by 5 -RRB- -RRB- is now the stack after that ... repeat ...
8.6.7 -LRB- 35 plus 80 -RRB- is now the stack, repeat again ...
8.6.8 115 is now the stack, and is returned.
8.6.0 The infix expression is converted to postfix form
8.6.0 by converting them to postfix expressions and putting the operations in a stack
8.6.0 The computer converts the infix expression to postfix form.
8.6.1 Then evaluates the postfix expression.
8.6.0 infix expressions are converted to postfix expressions before they can be evaluated by a computer.
8.6.1 Operands stay in the same order.
8.6.2 Operators always follow the operands.
8.6.0 infix expressions are pointers evaluated by reference to the memory location
8.6.0 computers convert infix expressions to postfix form before evaluation
8.6.0 convert infix expressions to postfix expression and evaluate the postfix expression
8.6.0 When an operand is entered, the computer
8.6.1 Pushes it onto a stack
8.6.2 When an operator is entered, the computer
8.6.3 Applies it to the top two operands of the stack
8.6.4 Pops the operands from the stack
8.6.5 Pushes the result of the operation onto the stack
8.6.0 Computers convert an infix expression into a postfix expression.
8.6.1 They then push the numbers onto a stack and pop them out as they are needed.
8.6.0 infix expressions are converted to postfix, -LRB- i. e. 3 plus 2 is changed to 32 plus -RRB-
8.6.0 they are transformed into post-fix expressions, then evaluated with a stack.
8.6.0 Writing arithmetic expressions is called infix notation.
8.6.1 This is because a binary operator -LRB- like "plus"
8.6.2 -RRB- is written in between its two operands -LRB- as in "a plus b" -RRB- .
8.6.3 There are two alternative forms of notation used in certain situations.
8.6.4 One is prefix notation, in which an operator is written before its operands.
8.6.5 In prefix notation, the sum of a and b is written "plus a b".
8.6.6 This is the notation used to write function calls in mathematics and computer science.
8.6.7 It is also used in the Lisp and Scheme programming languages.
8.6.8 In postfix notation, an operator is written after its operands.
8.6.9 The sum of a and b is written "a b plus".
8.6.10 -LRB- You may have seen this as "reverse Polish notation".
8.6.11 -RRB- Postfix notation forms the conceptual basis for the way that arithmetic expressions are evaluated by a computer.
8.6.12 One important characteristic of both postfix and prefix notations is that they are unambiguous; no parentheses are needed to indicate the order of operations.
8.7.0 isEmptry -LRB- -RRB- or or determines if the stack is full or not pop -LRB- -RRB- or or to remove the top element if it is not the on you are looking for search -LRB- -RRB- or or you compare each element of the stack to the data you are looking for.
8.7.0 You would have to keep using peek or getTop to see what the top element is then popping the top element until peek or getTop provides the element you are looking for.
8.7.0 Push adds a given node to the top of the stack leaving previous nodes below.
8.7.1 Pop removes and returns the current top node of the stack.
8.7.0 Using linked lists and stacks, you would need a temp stack to retain the values.
8.7.1 Then you would use the Pop -LRB- -RRB- function to pop off each element and then compare it.
8.7.2 If its not the element your looking for, Push -LRB- -RRB- it to the temp stack.
8.7.3 Repeat until the element is found.
8.7.4 When you find it, Pop -LRB- -RRB- off the temp stack back onto the regular stack to have a complete stack again.
8.7.0 Pop each item off the top until you find what you are looking for.
8.7.1 If the stack ends up empty and you never found the item, then it does not exist in the stack.
8.7.2 It may also be necessary to save the popped values in case you want to recreate the stack.
8.7.0 if the stack is implemented using an array you could simply search the array for the item.
8.7.1 If the stack is implemented using a linked list you would have to pop the values off of the stack until either the value is found or the stack is empty, you would then have to have the items put back into the list.
8.7.0 You need to pop each item on the stack and compare the item.
8.7.1 Once the item is found, no more items need to be removed.
8.7.0 Pop an element from one stack, check to see if it is the desired element, if not push it onto another stack.
8.7.1 When finished, pop the items from the second stack and push them back onto the first stack -LRB- this will ensure the order of the elements is maintained -RRB- .
8.7.0 Basically pop the stack until you find the given element.
8.7.0 Iterate through the stack, checking the number against the current element.
8.7.0 pop and push
8.7.0 pop all elements off stack until you find that element and then push the popped elements back on the stack
8.7.0 Keep popping nodes and storing them in an alternate stack until the given element is found, then pop the given element and push the previously popped nodes back onto the stack.
8.7.0 either traverse the entire list and pop the given part or create a pointer system that automatically points to it.
8.7.0 Depends on the type of stack, on a true stack you will haft to pop all of the elements of the stack until you find the element you want, and then after that you will need to push all the elements that where removed back in to the stack in the order that they where removed.
8.7.1 With a Java style stack, where there is a peek function, it will return the element you wanted instead of requiring you to perform all the excessive actions that are required from a true stack.
8.7.0 if top item! equals given element pop the stack.
8.7.1 Repeat until item is found or stack is empty
8.7.0 could traverse through the list or array to find the element.
8.7.0 you need the pop opertation to go throught the stack and find the element.
8.7.0 createStack, push, isEmpty, pop, and a boolean return value.
8.7.0 you would have to traverse the stack popping each element to search it
8.7.0 Pop each element off the stack -LRB- and into another stack for storage -RRB- until the desired element is found.

9.3.0 you could use the first element of the list as the remove point and insert at the end f you do this you would have to shift the elements down each time you remove an item unless you make the array circular.
9.3.0 Utilizing indexes for the front and the back.
9.3.1 Front is 0 and as you add items the back index is incremented.
9.3.0 Declare two variables, front and rear, to be used to denote which elements in the array can be accessed.

9.3.0 Boolean isFullQ -LRB- queue -RRB- :: equals rear equals equals MAX QUEUE SIZE-1
9.4.0 A list can have unlimited elements in it.
9.4.1 You can push a node onto the end of the list and pop the one in the front.
9.4.0 theoretically you could do it two ways one of which uses more processing power and memory no larger than the queue is ever at when full and the other which uses almost infinite memory.
9.4.1 The more practical method would be two place the items in an array and remove the item in position one of the array after which you can shift the array and add another element if required.
9.4.2 The other option which can use infinite memory when used for long term queues such as job scheduling that goes nonstop for extended periods. that is to implement an array and add the items read item one raise your counter value to two ecetera and continue adding more elements to the array. the downside to this method is after you use element one it is still in memory. or im crazy who knows
9.4.0 By implementing a list in which a tail pointer points to the item most recently inserted onto the back of the list and a head pointer which points to the item least recently inserted onto the list.
9.4.1 Also, items can only be removed from the front of the list and can only be added to the back of the list.
9.4.0 You can use list to represent the items in a queue.
9.4.0 Have a pointer to the last element in the list and then use enqueue to insert items there.

9.4.0 you use the first element in the list as the remove point for the queue and insert items at the end of the list.
9.4.0 Utilizing a front pointer and a back pointer.
9.4.1 The front poiner and back pointer points to the first item into the queue.
9.4.2 As you add items, the front remains the same but the back poiner "next 'points to the new item and the new item is assigned to become the 'new" back pointer.
9.4.0 Implement a linked list that only allows nodes to be added to the tail and can only be retrieved from the head.
9.4.0 Check if list is empty and add elements to the list.
9.4.0 make a linked list and add on to the front and delete from the back, keep track of both to do so.
9.4.0 by making the head of the list the beginning of the queue and the last listed item the insertion point of the queue
9.4.0 throw in data at the head and take it out at the tail
9.4.0 You create a list of nodes that had a head and a top pointer, and the functions are basically the same substituting pop and push with enqueue and dequeue
9.4.0 fairly easy ... singly linked list with a pointer to the head and tail of hte list. deque first item in que, create temp pointer to next element, delete head, and then make head the temporary pointer. enque new item, use pointer to end of list, add a new item to the next item of the tail, and make the tail the next item of the current tail.
9.4.0 Use a linked list with 2 pointers, one to the front and one to the back.
9.4.1 As long as back! equals front, the queue is not empty.
9.4.0 create a node with the input data, continue to add to the list. when dequeueing get the first elements data and set the next element in the list as the new first element

9.5.1 Less code, and no size limitation or declaration ... which means it is also more efficient and versatile.
9.5.0 list based is prefered because it does not have a set size and insertion and deletion can be done very quickly of you keep pointers to first element and last.
9.5.0 List based is preferred because there are space issues with array based due to rightward drift.
9.5.1 The fix for rightward drift requires constant shifting of the queue data.
9.5.0 Similar to stacks, linked lists are preferable for queues because the size can be adjusted.
9.5.0 array-based is preferred because all you have to keep track of is the array itself and the count.
9.5.0 list because its size is not defined
9.5.0 List-based, because when you enqueue -LRB- or dequeue depending upon your implementation -RRB- you would need to shift all elements to another space with an array, causing a horrid time complexity for large data sets, where as you can just modify the pointers in a list for a constant time complexity
9.5.0 queue 's are best with lists, especially if the tail is kept track of, as the list can be dynamically grown without losing track of the head or tail.
9.5.0 list based, its much simpler and the run time is better

9.5.0 list based.
9.5.1 It can dynamically grow and has fewer restrictions.
9.5.0 list based is preferred because memory allocation is not an issue
9.5.0 List based solutions are preferred, because they allow for queues of any size.
9.5.0 I think array based is batter, because of fixed size, but on other had list base is more flaxible.
9.5.1 You do not have to worry about the size
9.5.0 list based because you dont need to shift the elements like you do in array based queues
9.5.0 List-based because memory is not constricted.
9.5.0 list based because the array based has to have a fixed size, it cannot be added to or removed from as easily
9.5.0 list-based array is easier and more scalable
9.5.0 list based becuase an arrary based has to have an arrary size and needs to be pre-defined and cannot be changed dynamically.

12.4.0 it scans the list and selects the smallest -LRB- largest -RRB- element and places it in the front, increment the curPtr by one, scan the list again for the next smallest -LRB- largest -RRB- element and place it in with respect with the other sorted elements.
12.4.0 Selection sort searches the array for the lowest value and swaps it with the first value in the array.
12.4.1 Then searches for the next lowest value and swaps it with the second item in the array, and so on.
12.4.0 Compare the largest element to the front element and swap data according to value if needed.
12.4.0 Selection sort is a sorting algorithm that divides a list in half and has two lists.
12.4.1 It then compares the first elements in both these lists and puts these elements in another list, having the smaller element before the bigger one.
12.4.0 Iterate through the list -LRB- assume list of integers -RRB- , find the smallest one, and put it in a separate "sorted" list ... then traverse again and find the next smallest, and move it to the sorted section ... and repeat until you run out of elements to sort.
12.4.0 selection sort selects the smallest element out of the list then the second smallest ... and sorts them acordingly.
12.4.0 You select the smallest element and place it on the left.
12.4.1 You select the smallest element and sort it with respect the the item already on the left.
12.4.2 You continue this till the end of the collection of items.
12.4.0 A selection sort scrolls through the data structure looking for the lowest -LRB- or highest -RRB- unsorted piece of data, moves it to the held spot, increments that spot by one, and starts the process over.
12.4.0 Selection sort works by finding the smallest element and then compares it with the largest and sorts the elements.
12.4.0 Selection sort is usually a recursive sorting method where you divide the elements to be sorted in half repeatedly.
12.4.1 You then sort the smallest case, then work your way up, sorting each until they are all sorted.
12.4.0 goes to the middle of the list, checks to see if it is greater or less then the value given and moves through the list accordingly to add the value into the proper place.
12.4.0 selection sort finds the lowest element in the data set and places it behind the pivot point.
12.4.0 Selection sort iterates through the array one element at a time, seeking the least value from the right and replacing the current value with it.
12.4.0 Selection sort traverses an unsorted array looking for the smallest value, when it is found it is put at the beginning of the unsorted array.
12.4.1 Performed several times, this will output a sorted array.
12.4.0 it runs through the list and finds the smallest -LRB- or largest -RRB- value and puts it at the appropriate position
12.4.0 pick a number, and set all values less than that number to the left, while all numbers on the right of that number is larger.
12.4.0 It takes the largest item in the unsorted array and swaps it with last item in the unsorted array.
12.4.0 by selecting the first object and comparing it with the next objects to find one that is smaller, if it does it switches the two. then it comes back the other way and sees if the objects previous to the last one is greater, if it does it switches them. it does this while decreasing the range it looks at until it finishes in the middle.
12.4.0 Selection sorts works by going through a certain list.
12.4.1 Goes through the unsorted list and selecting the largest item in the list and placing it in a sorted array.
12.4.2 There are two arrays, unsorted and sorted.
12.4.3 Complete these steps until the list is sorted.
12.4.0 selection sort works by pulling all of the values off to the side, leaving one value in the list.
12.4.1 It will then insert a value into the list. if the value is bigger it will go to the right, if smaller if will go to the left.
12.4.0 selection sort searches for the smallest element of the remaining data organization and places it at the largest point of the new data organization
12.4.0 Selection sort sorts an array one element at at time.
12.4.1 It first finds the element with the smallest key and puts it into the first location within its array or list, then finds the next smallest and puts it in the second location, and so on.
12.4.0 select an element compare it with 2nd element if it is greater, swap it
12.4.0 it selects the smallest element in a list and switches it with the element in its correct position, then it selects the next smallest and does the same ...
12.4.0 It starts at the first element and replaces it with the smallest element found to the right.
12.4.1 It then repeats with the next element in the list.
12.4.0 selection sort is when you pick a data member and put it in a new array, then you pick another data member and put it in order with the new array, then pick another and insert it in the correct place in the new array, etc etc
12.4.0 it searches through the entire data set for the best element to go in the current position, then it moves up a position and searches through the remainder of the set for the best element for the new position.
12.4.0 selection sort iterates through the array one element a time searching for the right and replacing current value with it.
12.5.0 A link list can grow to a infinite size as a array has a fixes size.
12.5.0 The advantage of linked lists is that they are not limited in size like arrays.
12.5.0 link lists dont have a fixed size
12.5.0 Linked Lists can be of variable size, where arrays have fixed size.
12.5.0 Linked lists do not have a definite size.
12.5.1 They can be as big or as small as needed, and they do not have to allocate extra memory for elements you do not need.
12.5.2 Arrays size must be defined.
12.5.0 a linked list has a dynamic size, but an array only has a fixed size and takes allot of extra operations to increase its size.
12.5.0 You do not have to predetermine your list size as you do with arrays.
12.5.1 Linked list have the ability to be as large as you want them adding memory as needed.
12.5.0 The main advantage to a linked list is that it can have it is size adjusted during runtime.
12.5.0 Linked lists are able to grow in size.
12.5.1 So elements can be added to the list.
12.5.0 Linked lists are not confined to a specific size, and can have elements added and removed far easier.
12.5.1 They are also easier to traverse.
12.5.0 There is no predetermined length
12.5.0 Inserts into a linked list are far cheaper than an insert into an array.
12.5.1 With an array, all items after the one being inserted must me shifted, with a linked list, only the pointers are replaced.
12.5.0 Linked lists may be dynamically grown.
12.5.0 Linked lists are very dynamic in that they can change and be added or subtracted to very easily because they are not linear in memory.
12.5.1 Arrays are pre-specified in size to be cast over a certain amount of disk space.
12.5.2 This makes insertion into Arrays difficult because all elements must be shifted, and if you reach the end of the array, you are done even if you have more data to input.
12.5.3 Linked Lists do not run into these problems.
12.5.0 linked lists have an indefinite size, whereas arrays are a specific size.
12.5.0 Linked lists have no predefined length, and thus you can have virtually unlimited items in that list.
12.5.0 They grow dynamically, unlike the fixed size array
12.5.0 you can add as many nodes as you like without having to specify a list size, if an array gets too big you have to copy its entire contents to another larger array to get more room
12.5.0 Linkded list does not have a fixed size.
12.5.1 Arrays have a fixed size.
12.5.0 Linked lists have a dynamic size, where as arrays have a static size.
12.5.0 linked lists do not have a memory constraint other than total memory
12.5.0 The primary advantage of linked lists over arrays is their ability to become larger or smaller as data is added and removed from the list, whereas arrays may waste memory for small data sets, and run out of space for large data sets.
12.5.0 Array have fixed size, in Link List are flexible for adding or deleting an element.
12.5.0 they are resizeable
12.5.0 Linked lists can be dynamically allocated and their size can change as needed.
12.5.0 linked lists do not have to have a specified size, they are easier to add to and remove from
12.5.0 they dont have a fixed size, no shiftnig needs to be done for insertion or deletion.
12.5.0 linked list many be dynamically grown.

12.6.0 It is a particular set of entities that are put in to a certain order by the enqueue and the dequeue functions.
12.6.0 A queue is a data type that operates under a FILO -LRB- First In Last Out -RRB- method.
12.6.1 This means that the first element inserted into the queue is the first element removed.
12.6.0 like a linked list except it is first in last out
12.6.0 A queue is like a stack except it follows FIFO -LRB- First in first out -RRB- .
12.6.0 A queue is a data structure where the first node in is the first node out.
12.6.0 A queue is a First in First out data structure much like a line for a movie theatre.
12.6.1 The first object in line is the first object to be handled or enacted upon.
12.6.0 its a lot like a stack, except that the first item put into the list is the first item to be taken from the list.
12.6.0 a first in first out list of items, like if you put 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 in the queue it will when you dequeue items remove the items in the same order as put in, so thus it will put out, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 in that exact order.
12.6.0 A linked list with a First In, Out structure dequeue at the head of the list enqueue at the end of the list
12.6.0 a list of objects that follow the rule first in first out, essentially a linked list that goes in order of the first object in the list is the first to be taken off.
12.6.0 A queue is an abstract data type that is based off of the priniple of first in first out.
12.6.1 FIFO.
12.6.2 The first item inserted into the list will the first item taken out.
12.6.0 It is a "first in first out" data structure.
12.6.1 It can be implemented with either a linked list or an array.
12.6.0 an ordered list that performs task in the order of first in first out. adding items to the queue places items behind the rest of them. taking items off the queue takes the one that has waited the longest.
12.6.0 A queue is a linear, first-in first-out data structure.
12.6.1 Data must be accessed in the same order it was put into the queue, so only the oldest item in the queue is accessible at any time.
12.6.2 Main functions defined are enqueue and dequeue.
12.6.0 Queue is a buffer, it follows the rule of First In and First out.
12.6.1 Queue is very useful in computer science for scheduleing.
12.6.0 a queue is a set of elements where the first element inserted is the first element to be removed
12.6.0 Is a list of items where the the user only has access to the first element and each new element is added at the end.
12.6.0 a queue is a list of data that follows the fifo principle, an example of this would be when you get into a line at a movie theater ... the first one there gets to buy a ticket first
12.6.0 A queue is a data structure that holds a set of objects, which has a FIFO -LRB- first in first out -RRB- priority.

12.8.0 When you traverse a tree of any size you will visit each node three times.
12.8.1 Its on the order of 3n or O -LRB- n -RRB- running time.
12.8.0 The Euler tour traversal of a tree begins at the root and visits each node in the tree from the left, then bottom, then right sides.
12.8.0 Where you visit the in order according to its data value.
12.8.0 It is a tree that shows how it functions.
12.8.1 It contains parents, children, siblings, ancestors and descendents.
12.8.2 The use of tree type algorithm is also an alternative sorting algorithm.
12.8.0 Start from the root, circle around the whole "tree", naming each node as you see it.
12.8.0 it is where you visit the parent then you vistit the children
12.8.0 To start from the root, traveling left and visiting ever child along the way till you return to the root from the right.
12.8.0 Traversing a tree down to it is terminal child and then all of it is siblings, then it traverses up the terminal child 's parent and all of it is siblings -LRB- repeating the first step if those siblings have children -RRB- until the root node has been visited.
12.8.0 The Euler tour traversal of a tree the function that iteratively keeps track of the pointer on each node.
12.8.0 You travel the outside edge of the tree, clockwise, while naming each node.
12.8.0 children to root
12.8.0 go to the bottom of the left sub tree and visit the parent and then its children
12.8.0 The Euler tour traverses through the tree in a rubber-band style shape.
12.8.0 The Euler tour traversal of a tree is a specific way of navigating a tree that involves following the tree starting at the very top and moving along the left side of the tree first, cupping in to visit the parents of children nodes.
12.8.1 It allows for each node to be visited from the left, the right and the bottom.
12.8.2 The Euler tour first progresses to a left child if there is one, then progresses to it is parent, then it is next child, then it is parent 's parent.
12.8.0 it runs through the parents and the children in order
12.8.0 it starts node on the left of the root and then proceeds to visits each node in a left to right order, visits the root, and then proceeds to repeat the previous step on the right side of the tree.
12.8.0 Travel from the root to the farthest left child
12.8.1 Backup, travel the leftmost children in the right side repeat until reaching the rightmost child.
12.8.0 has preorder, in order, and postorder of a tree. preorder equals puts the parent node in front of the child node -LRB- s -RRB- . in order equals puts the parent node between the left child and right child node -LRB- s -RRB- . postorder equals puts the parent node after the child node -LRB- s -RRB- .
12.8.0 The Euler traveral is when you go through a tree looking for nodes to put in the order of left, root, right.
12.8.1 Like inOrder traversal.
12.8.0 An Euler traversal is a traversal that begins with the root, and travels around the outside of the tree.
12.8.1 Each element in the tree is visited 3 times.
12.8.2 From the left, from the bottom and from the right.
12.8.0 Euler tour traversal of a tree traverses down each branch straight to one leaf then starts again at the root and repeats until all elements have been traversed.
12.8.0 The Euler tour visits every node in a tree, starting with the root and working around the tree counterclockwise. in-order, post-order, and pre-order traversals can be seen as variations of the Euler tour traversal.
12.8.0 not answered
12.8.0 to traverse going down to the left then go to the right of last children and back to the top .. kind of like going around the tree
12.8.0 You recursively visit every node on the list.
12.8.1 You visit the node from the left, the bottom, and from the right.
12.8.0 the euler tour is a way to traverse a tree where you come into contact with each node three times, from the left, from the right, and from the bottom
12.8.0 traversing a tree level by level
12.8.0 The Euler traversal through the tree in a rubber band style shape.
12.9.0 if root, set root to NULL else if deleting right leaf, set rightPtr of parent node to NULL else if deleting left leaf, set leftPtr of parent node to NULL else if deleting a left or right subtree child node, set the max leaf child in the left subtree as the new child node.
12.9.0 Traverse the tree and find the node, if the node has no children, simply delete it; otherwise set the node 's data equal to the data of one of its children then set the pointer for that child to NULL.
12.9.0 first attaching the elements from the node to be deleting to alternate nodes and then deleting that node. delete node;
12.9.0 If you delete a node from a tree, you have to link that nodes parents to the children of that node.
12.9.0 Must delete the information that the node contains -LRB- to free up memory or "garbage collect"
12.9.1 -RRB- and also delete the pointer -LRB- in that node 's "parent"
12.9.2 -RRB- that points to the node you wish to delete.
12.9.0 you replace the node with the largest element of its left subtree or replace it with the smallest element of the right subtree.
12.9.0 You traverse the tree till you find the node you are wanting to delete.
12.9.1 If the node has no children you delete it.
12.9.2 If the node has children, before you delete, you find the left-most of its children and attach it to the root then you can delete the node.
12.9.0 Link the to-be-deleted 's left child to the to-be-deleted 's parent 's left child pointer.
12.9.0 The way you delete a node from a binary search tree is first you have take the root and then see the nodes that are coming from the root.
12.9.1 And delete the nodes and set the root to NULL.
12.9.0 You remove the element from the tree and move the next highest element from the left into its place.
12.9.0 delete node;
12.9.0 the deletion of a node depends upon if it has children and if it is an AVL binary search tree.
12.9.1 Assuming it is not an AVL tree, and the node being deleted has no children, you just set its pointer to null.
12.9.2 If it has a left child or a right child exclusively, that child replaces the deleted node, if it has two children, the left most child of the right sub tree -LRB- or right most child of the left subtree -RRB- will replace it
12.9.0 If the node is a leaf, just set it is parent 's pointer to null and delete it, if it has a single child, set the parent 's pointer to the child and delete; if it has two children, set the node to one of the middle children and remove that child from its previous position as a leaf -LRB- rightmost child of the left subtree or leftmost child of the right subtree -RRB- .
12.9.0 In a binary search tree, you must first establish a proper replacement for the node you are about to delete, usually a child from the soon to be deleted node.
12.9.1 Once that replacement node has been found, you simply reassign it to where the node that is going to be deleted is.
12.9.2 After the deleted node has been usurped, you remove the deleted node from memory so it may be used again.
12.9.0 It all depends on where the node is located.
12.9.1 If its a child it can just be deleted but for a node inside the tree it must be replaced with another node that works in its place.
12.9.0 if the node has no children, delete it right away, otherwise, put either the furthest right node on the left side or the furthest left node on the right side in that place and perform a the above on that node to guarantee that it is children get handled properly.
12.9.0 Create a temp Node
12.9.1 Set temp 's values to the Node after head or NULL in the case of only head Node in the list.
12.9.2 Set head equal to temp.
12.9.3 Delete temp
12.9.0 by searching down the tree until you find the node, and replacing the link to that node with the greatest child node on the left subtree or the least child node on the right subtree.
12.9.0 Set the nodes to NULL, where that it does not point to anything, and the use the DELETE opertator to clear space from memory.
12.9.0 You must first traverse the tree to find the appropriate value.
12.9.1 Then you must make sure that the node is a leaf node.
12.9.2 If it is, then you can delete the pointer to that specific node.
12.9.0 if the node is a leaf, you set it is parent 's pointer to null. if the node is in the tree you must replace the node with one in the tree: either the largest in the left of the tree or the smallest in the right of the tree. this can be done recursively if needed.
12.9.0 if the node is a leaf it can simply be deallocated or deleted from memory, and its parent 's reference to it changed to NULL.
12.9.1 If the node has a single child, the pointer to it should be made to point to its child before deleting the node.
12.9.2 Should the node have two children, the easiest solution may be to copy the node 's entire subtree to a new array or tree, delete the node and all descendants, then add the elements taken from the subtree back into the main tree.
12.9.0 not answered
12.9.0 you cannot delete a node because that can cause a node to have more than 2 children
12.9.0 You search the tree for the node using recursion.
12.9.1 When you find the node, you determine whether it is a leaf or a internal node.
12.9.2 If it is a leaf, you just delete it and set the parent pointer to that node to NULL.
12.9.3 If it is a node, you replace the node with either of the children nodes.
12.9.0 to delete the node, you would have to link the children nodes that are connected to the node to be deleted to the remaining nodes of the tree in such a way that nodes on the right of the parent node are larger than the parent and nodes on the left of the parent node are smaller
12.9.0 if it has no children, you just delete it. if it only has one child, just replace the node with whichever child it has. if it has both children, replace it with one of its children, and send the other child down along the other side of the new node.
12.9.0 pointer to the child and delete it has 2 children set the node to the child and delete it. the node to th middle will then take its place
12.10.0 Log -LRB- n -RRB- where n is the number of nodes.
12.10.0 log -LRB- n -RRB- steps
12.10.0 The number of levels and the height of the tree
12.10.0 It is the same as the height of the tree.
12.10.0 Given n elements, it would take n divided by 2 steps to find the search criteria.
12.10.0 log n
12.10.0 Depends on the location of the node you are looking for.
12.10.1 If it is the root it is one step. else
12.10.2 If it is smaller than the current you are on node you go to the left.
12.10.3 If it is larger than the current node you are on go to the right.
12.10.0 2 to the power of n where n is the of levels the binary tree has
12.10.0 The number of steps to search a node is the function n minus 1.
12.10.0 It would take n divided by 2 elements, given n.

12.10.1 Where n is the number of items in the tree.
12.10.2 If the binary search tree is constructed poorly, with for instance the root of the tree being 1, and progressing downwards and to the right its children are each more than the last: you have a one-way linear linked list.
12.10.3 That worse case scenario would be a full traversal at O -LRB- n -RRB- time.
12.10.4 Where n is the number of items in the tree.
12.10.0 N, n being the number of nodes.
12.10.0 depending on the way that the tree is ordered, it could be anywhere between log -LRB- n -RRB- and N steps.
12.10.0 log -LRB- n -RRB-
12.10.0 worst case scenario equals the number of levels of the tree, ie: the node at the farthest position from the root node. best case equals 1 step if its the root node.
12.10.0 3 steps at most.
12.10.1 There are 3 cases.
12.10.0 log -LRB- n -RRB- where n equals the total number of nodes in the tree.
12.10.0 the same number of steps as the number of levels or generations in the tree
12.10.0 to find a node in a binary search tree takes at most the same number of steps as there are levels of the tree.
12.10.0 three steps visit the root node, then go to right subtree, after visiting right subtree visit left subtree
12.10.0 log n
12.10.0 -LRB- n -LRB- n minus 1 -RRB- -RRB- divided by 2
12.10.0 2n-1
12.10.0 it takes at most h steps, where h is the height of the tree.
12.10.0 it depends on the install search tree then from there for whatever the case is the it repeats it back along the case of the primary node

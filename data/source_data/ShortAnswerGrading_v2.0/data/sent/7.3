7.3 Array can retrieve memory from any place in the list while in a link list you have to traverse through each individual node. <STOP>
7.3 Arrays require less memory than linked lists and allow direct access to a specified item. <STOP> Also, insertion and deletion in arrays does not require a list traversal. <STOP>
7.3 Access to a particular element is very fast, because its location in memory can be determined mathematically and accessed directly. <STOP>
7.3 Arrays are good for random access and good for sequential access which are both in constant time. <STOP> Where linked lists are linear for random access. <STOP> Arrays are faster in this case. <STOP>
7.3 An array is capable of accessing any part of that array based on the index. <STOP> The link list must be traversed from the beginning or the end, that is, data can only be accessed if it is adjacent to the previous or next nodes. <STOP>
7.3 On the other hand, arrays allow random access, while linked lists allow only sequential access to elements. <STOP> Singly-linked lists, in fact, can only be traversed in one direction. <STOP>
7.3 You have to keep up with the head of the list. <STOP>
7.3 Arrays are easier to implement and require less memory <STOP>
7.3 Linked list has an increase complexity of the implementation. <STOP> The linked list has an array that keeps growing which leads to a increase in memory. <STOP>
7.3 You do not have to iterate through the entire list to access elements. <STOP>
7.3 you can go forwards and backwards and point to any piece of data at any given time where linked lists have to point to the next piece of data. <STOP>
7.3 Take up less memory and are contiguously stored <STOP>
7.3 Arrays, being fixed, are less error prone. <STOP>
7.3 Arrays have a set list of values. <STOP> Meaning you can pick a spot in the array such as a [7] picks the 8th spot in the array. <STOP> With linked lists you have to keep track with pointers if you want to take specific nodes out, otherwise you must traverse the entire list. <STOP>
7.3 direct access to elements, and speed, linked lists have increased search times to access elements even if the list is sorted. <STOP> -LRB- like getting the last element without a pointer directly to the end of the list. <STOP> -RRB- <STOP>
7.3 Array items are accessed directly with equal access time <STOP>
7.3 Array-bases implementations require less memory than a pointer-bases one. <STOP>
7.3 You can access specific elements quickly in an array. <STOP> In a linked list you must traverse the list to get access the same element. <STOP>
7.3 link lists only allow sequential access where arrays allow random access <STOP>
7.3 Any entitiy in an array may accessed immediately, whereas a linked list must be traversed one item at a time because each object only points adjacent objects <STOP>
7.3 Array based implementation requires less memory than lined lists based implementation <STOP>
7.3 Array-based implementations require less memory than a pointer-based ones <STOP>
7.3 You can go up and down an array, but you can only go one direction while traversing a linked list. <STOP>
7.3 arrays allow for the random access of any item cotained a any time, linked lists must be gone through toget to the desired item <STOP>
7.3 In arrays you have direct access to each element, but in linked lists you have to traverse the list up to the element that you need. <STOP>
7.3 Array size is fixed. <STOP> But Linked is not fixed, data is also accessed quicker in array list, also memory requirement is less and no pointers required. <STOP> Arrays have random access and less overheads compared to Linked list have sequential access only with too much overheads and no cache memory support. <STOP> On the other hand, arrays allow random access, while linked lists allow only sequential access to elements. <STOP> Singly-linked lists, in fact, can only be traversed in one direction. <STOP>

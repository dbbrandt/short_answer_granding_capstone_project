10.7 This is on the runtime order of log -LRB- n -RRB- where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. <STOP>
10.7 In a binary search tree of size "n" it takes log -LRB- n -RRB- comparisons to find a specified element. <STOP>
10.7 n minus 1 divided by 2 is the algorithm to compare and find an element. <STOP>
10.7 At most its equivalent to the height of the tree. <STOP>
10.7 Log -LRB- n -RRB- <STOP>
10.7 O -LRB- log n -RRB- <STOP>
10.7 Depends on what half of the tree and the levels you have. <STOP>

10.7 at the minimum log -LRB- n -RRB- or log -LRB- 2 -RRB- , at the maximum N searches, where N is the number of nodes. <STOP>
10.7 O -LRB- n -RRB- <STOP>
10.7 It takes at most 3 comparisons to find and element in a binary search tree <STOP>
10.7 log -LRB- n -RRB- where n equals the number of nodes. <STOP>
10.7 it takes as many comparisons as the number of levels of the binary search tree. it only compares one number at each level <STOP>
10.7 At most it takes one less comparisons than the tree 's height. <STOP> In big-O notation it takes O -LRB- log n -RRB- comparisons if the tree is balanced. <STOP>
10.7 O -LRB- log n -RRB- <STOP>
10.7 log n comparisons <STOP>
10.7 -LRB- n to the power of k -RRB- minus 1 where k is the height of the tree <STOP>
10.7 it takes h comparisons, where h is the height of the tree <STOP>
10.7 2 way key comparison <STOP>

1.6 They can be declared right before they are used, but it is a good practice to declare them at the beginning of the program and label what they are food. <STOP>
1.6 In the Function main -LRB- -RRB- before using the variable. <STOP>
1.6 Local variables are declared inside the method or function they will be used in at the beginning of the method. <STOP> Global variables are declared outside of any function or method, generally before functions are defined. <STOP>
1.6 Variables are declared where ever it is defined either inside a block locally or outside a block globally. <STOP>
1.6 Variables are declared before they are actually used. <STOP> They can be declared before main -LRB- -RRB- to use globally <STOP>
1.6 For good programing practice they should be declared before main -LRB- -RRB- , but should at least be declared before they are used. <STOP>
1.6 They can be declared globally just before the main method -LRB- but also outside of it -RRB- ... or variables can be subject to only the method they are scoped within, but would still be declared at the beginning of that method -LRB- but inside of it -RRB- . <STOP>
1.6 local variables are declared inside the method while global variables are declared in the body. <STOP>
1.6 Any where in the main function. <STOP>
1.6 Globally for an entire program, and locally for individual functions -LRB- including FOR statements -RRB- <STOP>
1.6 They are usually declared at the beginning before they can be used in the program. <STOP> They always contain a name and a data type. <STOP>
1.6 Inside the method. <STOP>
1.6 at the top <STOP>
1.6 Global variables are declared in the body of the code. <STOP> Local variables are declared in the function they are to be used -LRB- unless the function is being passed a variable -RRB- . <STOP> Variables should always be declared before use. <STOP>
1.6 Variables are usually declared at the beginning of a module of C plus plus code. <STOP>
1.6 In the main function, usually at the top of code. <STOP> They can be declared almost anywhere, but must be declared before the code can use or act upon them. <STOP>
1.6 in the very beginning of the program. <STOP> Before the main -LRB- -RRB- starts. <STOP>
1.6 In the declaration of Functions, for statements, and while statements. in the body of If, For, while, do while, statements, in namespaces, headers, etc -LRB- almost anywhere. <STOP> -RRB- anywhere in the program, as long as it is on it is own line. <STOP>
1.6 After declaration of the variable 's data type. <STOP>
1.6 anywhere in the code, can be at the top, or in the middle of the code, or anywhere. <STOP>
1.6 Before they are used. <STOP>
1.6 Anywhere in the same scope before they are used <STOP>
1.6 variables can be declared in classes and methods. <STOP>
1.6 inside the function scope and outside of the function scope in case of global variables <STOP>
1.6 global variables are declared in the main function local variables are declared in any other function <STOP>
1.6 Variables are usually declared at the very beginning of a C plus plus program, but can be declared any in the program as long as they appear before they are called upon. <STOP>
1.6 Variables are declared in the main function, before any operation is attempted with the variables. <STOP>
1.6 anywhere, but where you declare them depends on where you want them to be accessible -LRB- their scope -RRB- <STOP>
1.6 It depends if it s a global then they have to be declared out side the source code to be used in every scope however a local variable is one declared in a local function etc. which obviously doesn t need to be declared outside the variable seeing how it is used for the function or block its being called for. <STOP>

4.5 at least 2, depending on how many arrays are being used. <STOP>
4.5 all of them. <STOP>
4.5 When passing a multi-dimensional array, all dimensions must be specified except for the first dimension. <STOP>
4.5 It depends what parameters you are passing in a multidimensional. <STOP> A multideminsional can have more than two dimensions. <STOP>
4.5 The first dimension is not required however the subsequent dimension -LRB- s -RRB- are needed for the compiler. <STOP>
4.5 all but the first <STOP>
4.5 All of the dimensions must be specified. <STOP>
4.5 just the first one at least. <STOP>
4.5 Two paramaters, the array and how many columns. array -LRB- a [], [3] -RRB- <STOP>
4.5 The size of the first dimension can be omitted, same as a regular array. <STOP> However, for every dimension outside the first, the size of those dimensions must be specified when passed, for example, a multi-dimensional array of [2] [4] [6] with the name MultiArray would be passed as: "MultiArray [] [4] [6], 2" <STOP>
4.5 Size of subsequent dimensions are required. <STOP> Compiler must know how many elements to skip to move to the second element in the first dimension <STOP>
4.5 Every dimension after the first. <STOP>
4.5 both <STOP>
4.5 the size of the first dimension does not need to be specified, but all other dimensions do. <STOP>
4.5 when passing -LRB- in main -RRB- a multidimensional array to a function, no dimensions need be specified <STOP>
4.5 All dimensions except for the first one need to be specified when passing an array to a function, the compiler needs to know how many memory addresses to skip to make it back to the 2nd element in the first dimension. <STOP> The size of the first dimension does not need to be specified. <STOP>
4.5 as many as there are dimensions. <STOP> Most commonly just rows and columns <STOP>
4.5 at least 2, but it should always equal the number of dimensions that the argument is expecting ... like ... blah [] [] [] [] will require 4 dimensional array input. blah [] [] [] will require a 3 dimensional array. blah [] [] will require a 2 dimensional array. <STOP>
4.5 None, just pass the array name. <STOP>
4.5 all subsequent dimensions after the first dimension. first is not needed to be specified. <STOP>
4.5 all dimensions, excluding the first one. <STOP>
4.5 all dimensions but the first <STOP>
4.5 the first needs to be specified by size and the rest need only be stated -LRB- first like this [3] then [] [] [] -RRB- <STOP>
4.5 one less than the number of dimensions the array contains <STOP>
4.5 not answered <STOP>
4.5 one <STOP>
4.5 All subsequent dimensions after the first one. <STOP>
4.5 two or more <STOP>
4.5 1 less than the total number of dimensions <STOP>
4.5 Multi dimensional arrays are accessed using more than 1 index, one for each dimension at least. <STOP>

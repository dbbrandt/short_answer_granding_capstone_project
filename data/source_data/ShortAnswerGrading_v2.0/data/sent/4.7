4.7 usually it is by rows then followed by the column, but it is up to the programmer to determine how values are stored in bi-dimensional arrays. <STOP>
4.7 by rows. <STOP>
4.7 Multi-dimensional arrays are stored in memory by rows. <STOP>
4.7 A bi-dimensional or two-dimensional array is stored in a row-column matrix. <STOP> Where the first index indicates the row and the second indicates the column. <STOP> This means that when array elements are accessed in the order in which they are actually stored in memory, the right index changes faster than the left. <STOP>
4.7 They are stored in memory in rows. <STOP>

4.7 m-by-n. by row-column. <STOP>
4.7 bi-dimensional arrays are stored by rows <STOP>
4.7 By rows. <STOP>
4.7 By column. <STOP>
4.7 columns <STOP>
4.7 By rows <STOP>
4.7 by-dimensional arrays are stored by row <STOP>
4.7 x by y is row by column. <STOP> So x is rows, and y is columns. <STOP> Since the length of the row is not needed when passing the array to the function, this leads me to believe that bi-dimensional arrays are stored by rows at a time. <STOP>
4.7 Both, they are stored in seperate sections. <STOP>
4.7 by rows, then columns. <STOP>

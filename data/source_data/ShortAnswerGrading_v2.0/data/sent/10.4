10.4 A tree data structure in which each done has at most two children, typical called left and right nodes. <STOP> The right node is usually greater than the left node and the parent node. <STOP>
10.4 A binary tree is a set of nodes that is either empty or partitioned into a root node and one or two subsets that are binary subtrees of the root. <STOP> Each node can have no more than two children, a right and a left child. <STOP>
10.4 A set of nodes that is either empty or partitioned into a root node and one or two subsets that are binary subtrees of the root. <STOP> Each node has at most two children, the left child and the right child. <STOP>
10.4 A set of zero or more nodes, partitioned into a root node and two possibly empty sets that are binary trees. <STOP> Thus, each node in a binary tree has at most two children, the left child and the right child. <STOP>
10.4 A tree in which each parent has a maximum of 2 children. <STOP>
10.4 a tree where each node has at most 2 children. <STOP>
10.4 a tree with up to two children or a right subtree and a left subtree <STOP>
10.4 A binary tree is a tree in which all nodes have a maximum of two degrees, or can only have two children each. <STOP>
10.4 a binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children. <STOP>
10.4 a tree with only 2 joints, left and right <STOP>
10.4 A binary search tree is a tree that also has the condition that each node may have at maximum 2 children <STOP>
10.4 a tree where each parent can have at max two children. <STOP>
10.4 a list of numbers that are ordered compared to how they compare to the other numbers already added in the tree <STOP>
10.4 a tree where each node can have at most 2 children. <STOP>
10.4 Starting at the root node, it branches off into one or two subsets that are binary subtrees of the root. <STOP> Each node has at most two children, the left child and the right child. <STOP>

10.4 a binary tree is a special search tree where each node has either 2, 1, or 0 children <STOP>
10.4 a binary tree is a special type of tree where each node can only have at maximum 2 children <STOP>
10.4 A binary tree is a special type of inverted tree in which each element has only two branches below it. <STOP>

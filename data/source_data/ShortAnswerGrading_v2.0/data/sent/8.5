8.5 List based is preferred because it is not constrained to a fix size. <STOP> The down fall is that it takes up more memory because each node has at least two parts, the item and the pointer. <STOP>
8.5 List based is preferred because the stack you create is not limited in size and can increase or decrease in size as needed. <STOP>
8.5 Array-based prevents the push operation from adding an item to the stack if the stack 's size limit, which is the size of the array, has been reached. <STOP> List-base much simpler to write and does not have a fixed size. <STOP>
8.5 Array based because they are faster, easier to keep track of and less complexity in code. <STOP>
8.5 list-based because it does not use a fixed size like an array would. <STOP>
8.5 usually linked list because it does not have a fixed size. <STOP> But if you know or want to set a max size array is better. <STOP>
8.5 List-based. <STOP> Allows more flexablity with size of the stack. <STOP>
8.5 Linked lists are preferred for implementing stacks because they are not limited to a set number of elements. <STOP>
8.5 The list-based implementation is preferred since the big O -LRB- 1 -RRB- is very efficient. <STOP>
8.5 Linked list implementation is preferred. <STOP> That way, the list can be moved along without iteration. <STOP>
8.5 list because it its size is not determined <STOP>
8.5 Linked list because it takes up less memory and is scalable <STOP>
8.5 List-based, as the list can be grown dynamically, and as the head node is easily accessible. <STOP>
8.5 list based because the nodes are easier to work with and can be traversed easier <STOP>
8.5 list based, because of the lower processing overhead and nearly unlimited space, due to linked list design. <STOP>
8.5 list-based <STOP> It can grow and shrink dynamically, unlike the fixed size array. <STOP>
8.5 list based because arrays can become full, lists can grow or shrink as needed <STOP>
8.5 List-bases implentation is preferred. <STOP> One of the main reasons is because of that the list has no fixed size. <STOP>
8.5 Array is preferred. <STOP> Linked list implementation requires extra space to store pointers. <STOP> Space is allocated dynamically in the list-based which takes more time. <STOP>
8.5 link list is preferred because it makes pushing elements easier because there is no limit other than memory to the number of elements <STOP>
8.5 List-based implementation is much easier to implement, and allows the stack to scale as necessary. <STOP> It is therefore the preferred implementation. <STOP>
8.5 Array based implementation requires less memory than a list based. inceasing the size of a resizeable array can waste storage and time <STOP>
8.5 in an array based stack you would need to pre-determine a size, where in a list you can increase or decrease the size however you want. <STOP>
8.5 A list-based implementation is preferred because the list is more flexible than a array. <STOP>
8.5 i would think a list based would be better because you can change the pointers of the nodes to add or remove things from your stack <STOP>
8.5 list based, because it is much more flexible, easier to use, and doesnt need to have a max size defined when it is made. <STOP>
8.5 array based list is preferred because it can hold any size as long as u specify it. <STOP>

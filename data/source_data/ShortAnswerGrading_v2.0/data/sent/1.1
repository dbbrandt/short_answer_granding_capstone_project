1.1 High risk problems are address in the prototype program to make sure that the program is feasible. <STOP> A prototype may also be used to show a company that the software can be possibly programmed. <STOP>
1.1 To simulate portions of the desired final product with a quick and easy program that does a small specific job. <STOP> It is a way to help see what the problem is and how you may solve it in the final project. <STOP>
1.1 A prototype program simulates the behaviors of portions of the desired software product to allow for error checking. <STOP>
1.1 Defined in the Specification phase a prototype stimulates the behavior of portions of the desired software product. <STOP> Meaning, the role of a prototype is a temporary solution until the program itself is refined to be used extensively in problem solving. <STOP>
1.1 It is used to let the users have a first idea of the completed program and allow the clients to evaluate the program. <STOP> This can generate much feedback including software specifications and project estimations of the total project. <STOP>
1.1 To find problem and errors in a program before it is finalized <STOP>
1.1 To address major issues in the creation of the program. <STOP> There is no way to account for all possible bugs in the program, but it is possible to prove the program is tangible. <STOP>
1.1 you can break the whole program into prototype programs to simulate parts of the final program <STOP>
1.1 To provide an example or model of how the finished program should perfom. <STOP> Provides forsight of some of the challanges that would be encountered. <STOP> Provides opportunity To introduce changes To the finished program. <STOP>
1.1 Simulating the behavior of only a portion of the desired software product. <STOP>
1.1 A program that stimulates the behavior of portions of the desired software product. <STOP>
1.1 A program that simulates the behavior of portions of the desired software product. <STOP>
1.1 To lay out the basics and give you a starting point in the actual problem solving. <STOP>
1.1 To simulate problem solving for parts of the problem <STOP>
1.1 A prototype program provides a basic groundwork from which to further enhance and improve a solution to a problem. <STOP>
1.1 A prototype program is a part of the Specification phase of Software Problem Solvin. <STOP> It is employed to illustrate how the key problem or problems will be solved in a program, and sometimes serves as a base program to expand upon. <STOP>
1.1 Program that simulates the behavior of portions of the desired software product <STOP>
1.1 it provides a limited proof of concept to verify with the client before actually programming the whole application. <STOP>
1.1 It tests the main function of the program while leaving out the finer details. <STOP>
1.1 To get early feedback from users in early stages of development. <STOP> To show users a first idea of what the program will do or look like. <STOP> To make sure the program will meet requirements before intense programming begins. <STOP>
1.1 it simulates the behavior of portions of the desired software product <STOP>
1.1 It simulates the behavior of portions of the desired software product. <STOP>
1.1 A prototype program is used in problem solving to collect data for the problem. <STOP>
1.1 To ease the understanding of problem under discussion and to ease the understanding of the program itself <STOP>
1.1 it simulates the behavior of portions of the desired software product <STOP>
1.1 The role of a prototype program is to help spot key problems that may arise during the actual programing. <STOP>
1.1 the prototype program gives a general idea of what the end product will do, without the time and effort to write out the entire program. <STOP>
1.1 to show that a certain part of the program works as it is supposed to <STOP>
1.1 Prototype programming is an approach to programming that enables one to take an organized approach to developing an effective program with minimal errors and a strategic pattern when solving a problem. i. e. book gave an example of a costumer withdrawing money from a bank, the approach that was taking on a pseudo code level during the OOA or Design lvl before proceeding into creating a solution. <STOP>

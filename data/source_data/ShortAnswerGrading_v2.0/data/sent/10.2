10.2 Each level of a generation in the tree, some people do not count the root as a generation <STOP>
10.2 The height of a tree is in terms of the levels of its nodes such that, if the tree is empty its height is 0 otherwise its height is equal to the maximum level of its nodes. <STOP>
10.2 The height of a tree is the number of nodes on the longest path from the root to a leaf. <STOP>
10.2 The number of nodes on the longest path from the root of the tree to a leaf. <STOP>
10.2 Height equals the number of times you must progress down the levels of a tree to reach a leaf of the greatest distance from the root. <STOP>
10.2 the height of a tree is the length from the root to the furthest leaf <STOP>
10.2 The height is the number of generations -LRB- levels -RRB- from the root. <STOP>
10.2 The height of a tree is the number of levels between the root and the leaf farthest away from it. <STOP>
10.2 is the depth of its furthest leaf <STOP>
10.2 the number of nodes from root to leaf <STOP>
10.2 the distance from the deepest leaf to the root <STOP>
10.2 the number of generations or levels of a tree <STOP>
10.2 The intensity of the children. <STOP> Say you begin with one node, Thats one height. <STOP> Then you add two children to that node and then two children to each of those nodes and two children to each of THOSE nodes. <STOP> Youre current height would be 4. <STOP>
10.2 the number of levels of a tree, like a tree can have at minimum a depth of 3 and at most a height of 8 for 8 nodes. <STOP>
10.2 The number of nodes on the longest path from the root to the leaf. <STOP>
10.2 The height of a tree is the number of nodes on the longes path from the root to a leaf. <STOP>
10.2 is equal to the number of levels. levels between the root node and the terminal nodes. <STOP>
10.2 the number of generations or levels the tree has <STOP>
10.2 The height of a tree is the depth of its subtrees, that is, how many layers deep it is. <STOP>
10.2 is the number of generations in the tree <STOP>
10.2 The number of nodes on the longest path from the root to a leaf. <STOP>
10.2 the number of distinct levels of separation <STOP>
10.2 the height of a tree is how many levels of nodes that it has <STOP>
10.2 The connections between elements are called branches. <STOP> Trees are often called inverted trees because they are normally drawn with the root at the top. <STOP>

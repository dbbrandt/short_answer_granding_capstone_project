9.1 A data structure in c plus plus which is a collection of data that is kept in order. <STOP> First in first out. <STOP>
9.1 a queue is a list of objects in a particular order that is read one at a time starting at the first followed by the second and so on. <STOP>
9.1 A queue is an abstract data structure in which operations are performed at both ends giving the queue first in first out behavior. <STOP>
9.1 A queue stores a set of elements in a particular order. <STOP> Its principle of operation is FIFO -LRB- first in first out -RRB- , which means the first element inserted is the first one to be removed. <STOP>
9.1 An ADT whose first inserted item is the first item removed. <STOP> This uses the FIFO idea where items enter a queue at its back and leave at its front. <STOP>
9.1 Last in, last out architecture. <STOP> It works the same way a line at the bank would work, the person that is been waiting the longest gets served first. <STOP>
9.1 a queue is a data structure that stores elements in a First in First out order. <STOP>
9.1 A waiting list of items that operation in a FIFO -LRB- first in first out -RRB- order. <STOP>
9.1 A queue is similar to an array, except that the data can only be accessed sequentially rather than at random. <STOP> Unlike a stack, a queue follows FIFO. <STOP> First in, First out. <STOP>
9.1 is a particular kind of collection in which the entities in the collection are kept in order and the principal -LRB- or only -RRB- operations on the collection are the addition of entities to the rear terminal position and removal of entities from the front terminal position. <STOP> First in First Out -LRB- FIFO Method -RRB- . <STOP>
9.1 Like a linked list but first in first out <STOP>
9.1 A queue is a FIFO data structure. <STOP>
9.1 A queue is a first in first out data structure. <STOP>
9.1 Its like a stack, but uses the linked list to stack a little differently. <STOP> It is FIFO so the first thing enqueued is the first thing dequeued <STOP>
9.1 A first in, first out Abstract Data type that can be used to store values. <STOP>
9.1 Stores a set of elements in a particular order with a First In, First Out principle <STOP>
9.1 object that stores elements in order that follows first in first out. the first element added is the first one to come off. <STOP>
9.1 A quese is an list that stores a set of elements in a particular order. <STOP> It has Stack principle, but in this case, its "First In, First Out". <STOP> The first element inserted is the first element to be removed. <STOP>
9.1 a finite ordered list with zero or more elements, based upon First In First Out <STOP>
9.1 a data structure that performs operations in the order of first in first out FIFO <STOP>
9.1 A Queue is a "first in first out" data structure, such that the first element added is also the first removed. <STOP>
9.1 Queue is a buffer, which store element in a particular order <STOP>
9.1 stores a set of elements where the first element in, is the first element to be removed <STOP>
9.1 A data structure that removes nodes from the head and adds nodes at the tail. <STOP>
9.1 a queue is a list of things that follows the first in first out behavior <STOP>
9.1 a queue is a storage container that holds its objects in a first in, first out priority <STOP>
9.1 The queue is another data structure. <STOP> A physical analogy for a queue is a line at a bank. <STOP> When you go to the bank, customers go to the rear -LRB- end -RRB- of the line and customers come off of the line -LRB- i. e., are serviced -RRB- from the front of the line. <STOP>

11.8 the type char [] has a null -LRB- "n" -RRB- element at the very end. <STOP>
11.8 a variable char is basically any non command key on the keyboard that you can press. <STOP> A string is a collection of letters or numbers that is stored together to be used later. <STOP> Comonly strings are used for words. <STOP> Chars can be used for less but can have opperations performed on them in a useful way. <STOP>
11.8 The programmer must provide the null terminating character in a string of characters using type char [] and must also ensure that the array is large enough to contain the input string of characters and the null terminating character. <STOP>
11.8 String of characters are followed by a null statement. type string is for example string s; <STOP>
11.8 String contains a word where as char can contain phrases or a string of characters. <STOP>
11.8 a string is a variable with a single entinty of letters combined into one while in a char [] each letter is assigned a memory value and each has its own variable assigned i. e. char [0] char [1]. <STOP>
11.8 A string contains a null character at the end of the string, which makes it easily possible to get the string length. <STOP> A char array can have a virtually unlimited length, therefore, its size must be declared or limited. <STOP>
11.8 an array of characters stores a null character at the end <STOP>
11.8 When you read a string of characters, you also read in the white space. <STOP> When you read characters declared char you only read the characters, no white space. <STOP>
11.8 Character arrays will terminate at any whitespace, including spaces. <STOP> Strings terminate when they encounter the new line character. <STOP>
11.8 The difference is that a string that is declared a variable of type char [] is each char is included in the array versus the string of characters that is read into a variable. <STOP>
11.8 An array of strings reads the string literals, meaning anything within "quotes". <STOP> A char array reads a string as each individual character. <STOP>
11.8 character arrays can call on individual letters were a string array can only call words. <STOP>
11.8 The character array has an end of line character at the end of it. <STOP>
11.8 Type char [] may contain a null value as the last element, whereas type string will not. <STOP>
11.8 The variable of type string has a terminating character 0 at the end of it. <STOP>
11.8 the one that is type string has an extra string member. <STOP> The or 0 at the end. <STOP>
11.8 a string has variable size and function calls available, while an character array usually has a static size. <STOP>
11.8 a string char [] adds a null value to the end of the string. <STOP>
11.8 char array needs an end character signature and is made up of characters each separate from each other, a string is an object in itself, with a value that the user enters. <STOP>
11.8 the variable of type char [], each character is stored into a different memory address and can be accessed easly, where as in a string of character, its not easy to be able to access each character in the string. <STOP>
11.8 When the string is passed into the array char, individual characters are stored and can be manipulated. <STOP> Although when a word is stored into a string variable, it is stored as one word and not as individual characters. <STOP>
11.8 a string variable can change in size and is passed to functions by value, whereas a type char [] cannot change in size and is passed to functions by reference only <STOP>
11.8 A string type string acts as a single object, with individual char entities accessible only through specific string class functions. <STOP> A char array is less robust, but allows direct access to specific char entities. <STOP>
11.8 In arrays strings are stored as a characters -LRB- char [] -RRB- , each character of string will be stored in each memory location of the array, while string of characters is only one memory location. <STOP>
11.8 an array of characters has one more element, its last element, the terminating element, or null, which doesnt exist in a variable of type string <STOP>
11.8 A string of characters is a specific variable type that has no extra data at the end. <STOP> A string of type char [] is all the characters and a null -LRB- " <STOP> 0" <STOP> -RRB- <STOP>
11.8 a string of characters will have a null character or value at the end of the string <STOP>
11.8 when the characters are put in a char array, there is also a null terminating character added to the end, "0" <STOP>
11.8 string of characters that is read into a variable of type string includes, <STOP>

8.6 They are converted to post fix expressions. <STOP> It still follow the order of precedence for the operators. <STOP>
8.6 They are first converted to postfix expressions and then evaluated. <STOP>
8.6 Computers cannot evaulate infix expressions, it must first convert infix to postfix expression then it can evaluate. <STOP>
8.6 By using parentheses to have order in the expression. <STOP>
8.6 In postfix notation. <STOP>
8.6 computers usually convert infix expressions to post fix expression and evaluate them using a stack. <STOP>
8.6 they are converted to postfix <STOP>
8.6 Infix expressions are interpreted as postfix expressions by implementing stacks. <STOP>
8.6 They are first converted into an equivalent postfix expression so it can be read by the computer. <STOP>
8.6 The computer translates the infix expression to a postfix expression, then solves. <STOP>
8.6 in postfix format <STOP>
8.6 they use parenthisis and a stack to determine which evaluations need to be made first <STOP>
8.6 By throwing variables into a postfix expression and operands onto a parentheses regulated stack until end parentheses and enough variables to operate on are encountered. <STOP>
8.6 by being passed to the function by a leading term <STOP>
8.6 i have an hard time explaining this so i will show how infix is evaluated instead. <STOP> Start with an infix expression, like, -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- 5 plus 2 -RRB- multiplied by 5 -RRB- plus -LRB- 400 divided by -LRB- 2 plus 3 -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- , and push items until you get a " -RRB- " and once that happens, perform the operations until you reach an " <STOP> -LRB- " <STOP> ... with that complete, you will now have <STOP> -LRB- -LRB- 7 multiplied by 5 -RRB- plus -LRB- 400 divided by -LRB- 2 plus 3 -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- as now the expression that will be evaluated ... perform last step again ... <STOP> -LRB- 35 plus -LRB- 400 divided by -LRB- 2 plus 3 -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- is now the stack ... repeat agian ... <STOP> -LRB- 35 plus -LRB- 400 divided by 5 -RRB- -RRB- is now the stack after that ... repeat ... <STOP> -LRB- 35 plus 80 -RRB- is now the stack, repeat again ... <STOP> 115 is now the stack, and is returned. <STOP>
8.6 The infix expression is converted to postfix form <STOP>
8.6 by converting them to postfix expressions and putting the operations in a stack <STOP>
8.6 The computer converts the infix expression to postfix form. <STOP> Then evaluates the postfix expression. <STOP>
8.6 infix expressions are converted to postfix expressions before they can be evaluated by a computer. <STOP> Operands stay in the same order. <STOP> Operators always follow the operands. <STOP>
8.6 infix expressions are pointers evaluated by reference to the memory location <STOP>
8.6 computers convert infix expressions to postfix form before evaluation <STOP>
8.6 convert infix expressions to postfix expression and evaluate the postfix expression <STOP>
8.6 When an operand is entered, the computer <STOP> Pushes it onto a stack <STOP> When an operator is entered, the computer <STOP> Applies it to the top two operands of the stack <STOP> Pops the operands from the stack <STOP> Pushes the result of the operation onto the stack <STOP>
8.6 Computers convert an infix expression into a postfix expression. <STOP> They then push the numbers onto a stack and pop them out as they are needed. <STOP>
8.6 infix expressions are converted to postfix, -LRB- i. e. 3 plus 2 is changed to 32 plus -RRB- <STOP>
8.6 they are transformed into post-fix expressions, then evaluated with a stack. <STOP>
8.6 Writing arithmetic expressions is called infix notation. <STOP> This is because a binary operator -LRB- like "plus" <STOP> -RRB- is written in between its two operands -LRB- as in "a plus b" -RRB- . <STOP> There are two alternative forms of notation used in certain situations. <STOP> One is prefix notation, in which an operator is written before its operands. <STOP> In prefix notation, the sum of a and b is written "plus a b". <STOP> This is the notation used to write function calls in mathematics and computer science. <STOP> It is also used in the Lisp and Scheme programming languages. <STOP> In postfix notation, an operator is written after its operands. <STOP> The sum of a and b is written "a b plus". <STOP> -LRB- You may have seen this as "reverse Polish notation". <STOP> -RRB- Postfix notation forms the conceptual basis for the way that arithmetic expressions are evaluated by a computer. <STOP> One important characteristic of both postfix and prefix notations is that they are unambiguous; no parentheses are needed to indicate the order of operations. <STOP>

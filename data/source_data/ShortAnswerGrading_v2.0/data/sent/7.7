7.7 they take up twice as much memory for each node <STOP>
7.7 In a doubly linked list, there are more pointers to set and the mechanics of inserting and deleting are more difficult. <STOP> Also, the special cases at the beginning or end of the list are more complicated. <STOP>
7.7 There are more pointers to set, the mechanics of inserting into and deleting from a doubly linked list are a bit more involved than for a singly linked list. <STOP>
7.7 Insertion and deletion with a doubly linked list are more involved than with a singly linked list leaving more room for error and complex algorithms. <STOP>
7.7 Need more memory to store "previous" pointers. <STOP>
7.7 a node in a doubly linked list takes up more memory than a node in a singly linked list. <STOP>
7.7 You have to keep up with where you are and you have to consider the predecessor and successor connections when inserting or deleting. <STOP>
7.7 Each node requires an extra node, requires more memory, and is more difficult to insert and remove individual nodes <STOP>
7.7 Double-linked lists require more space per node, and their elementary operations are more expensive <STOP>
7.7 More difficult to delete and create nodes. <STOP>
7.7 They use more memory and you have to make 2 pointers and update 2 pointers each time you change the list. <STOP>
7.7 nodes take up more memory <STOP>
7.7 Each node requires an extra pointer -LRB- space requirements increased -RRB- , Insertion or deletion of a node takes a longer -LRB- more pointer operations -RRB- . <STOP>
7.7 its a little more confusing. <STOP> The special cases at the end and beginning become more difficult to do. <STOP>
7.7 increased actions to add and remove elements to the linked list. <STOP>
7.7 Inserting and deleting in a double-linked list is more involved, and has special cases at the beginning and end. <STOP>
7.7 The main disadvanate is that if hard to remove all items in the list. <STOP>
7.7 each node requires an extra pointer, taking up more storage. insertions and deletions require more pointer operations. <STOP>
7.7 in a doubly linked list there are twice as many pointers for each element, therefore more memory is used <STOP>
7.7 The process of adding and removing Nodes in a Doubly linked list is more complex than in a basic linked list <STOP>
7.7 Double linked lists require more space per node, and their elementary operation are more expensive <STOP>
7.7 1-each node requires an extra pointer, requiring more space <STOP> 2-the insertion or deletion of a node takes a bit longer, more pointer operations <STOP>
7.7 It takes up twice the storage needed. <STOP>
7.7 using more pointers to enable the backward movement takes up more memory, having more pointers make it slightly more work to add or remove a node from the list <STOP>
7.7 increased memory requirements, slightly more complicated when modifying elements in the list <STOP>
7.7 not answered <STOP>

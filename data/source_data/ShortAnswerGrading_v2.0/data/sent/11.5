11.5 A function that calls upon it self to solve a problem. <STOP> Each time it calls upon it self it splits up a problem into a simplier form until it reaches a "base case" which is the most simplest form of the problem. <STOP>
11.5 A function that calls itself to perform an opperation such as a factorial recursive function. <STOP>
11.5 not answered <STOP>
11.5 A base case that calls upon itself until the problem becomes smaller and terminates. <STOP>
11.5 It is a function that calls itself. <STOP> It runs multiple times until the base case is reached. <STOP>
11.5 a function that calls itself untill it reaches a base case. <STOP>
11.5 A function that calls itself. <STOP> Each time it does, it must get smaller, and eventually MUST converge to a base case, otherwise you can start an infinite loop. <STOP>
11.5 a function that calls itself until a base case is met <STOP>
11.5 A function that calls itself. <STOP> With each function call the problem is diminished. <STOP>
11.5 A function that calls itself to perform a certain task <STOP>
11.5 A recursive function is a function that calls itself. <STOP> Usually called the base case. <STOP> If the base case is not correct it causes a infinite loop. <STOP>
11.5 A function that calls itself, in order to solve a problem. <STOP>
11.5 a function that calls itself over and over until it finds the simplest form of solution, or the base case. <STOP>
11.5 A recursive function is a function that calls itself repeatedly until a base case is achieved. <STOP> The fundamental idea is to break one large problem into a series of smaller, similar problems. <STOP>
11.5 A recursive function typically simplifies a problem by calling itself, until arriving at a base case, at which it recursively returns a solution. <STOP>
11.5 A recursive function is a function that breaks down a large problem into two or more smaller problems and calls itself to solve those smaller problems until a base case or terminating point is reached. <STOP> At the base case, a definite answer is called and the function no longer recurses, but unwinds itself back through function calls to determine the answer to the original large problem. <STOP>
11.5 a function that calls itself into a loop with a base case for a loop exit. <STOP>
11.5 a function that calls itself until the base cases are met. <STOP>
11.5 A recursive function only knows how to solve base cases <STOP> A recursive function calls itself directly or indirectly until a base case is reached. <STOP>
11.5 a function that calls on itself and uses a base case to stop the recursion <STOP>
11.5 a function that calls itself, and which eaach calls get closer and close to the base case. <STOP>
11.5 A function that divides and conquers a problem. <STOP> There is a base case that will eventually be reached. <STOP> The function calls itself over and over until the base case is satisfied. <STOP>
11.5 a function that calls itself in the definition code <STOP>
11.5 A recursive function solves a problem by repeatedly calling itself. the initial problem is broken into successively smaller parts until a much simpler base case is reached. the solutions to each piece of the problem are then returned a step at a time. <STOP>
11.5 It invoke by itself again ana again, unless it reach bas case <STOP>
11.5 a function that solves a problem by dividing the problem into smaller problems, by calling its self again and again, until a base case is reached. <STOP>
11.5 A function that calls itself over and over again till a base case is reached, then it returns back to the original function. <STOP>
11.5 a recursive function is a function that during execution, calls itself over and over until a base case is reached <STOP>
11.5 A function that calls itself. <STOP> Usually used to split a problem into several smaller problems of the same type. <STOP>
11.5 function that calls it self till the base case is met <STOP>

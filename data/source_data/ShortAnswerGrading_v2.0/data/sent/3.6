3.6 A base case that is the simplest case for a problem so that the function will lead to it, if this does not happen then it will end up as an infinite loop. <STOP> And a condition to know when to terminate. <STOP>
3.6 badly designed algorithyms. using recursion for a non recursive problem. <STOP>
3.6 Infinite recursion can occur when the base case is omitted or the recursion step is written incorrectly so that it never converges on the base case. <STOP>
3.6 Infinite recursion is an infinite loop if the condition is not met. <STOP> Either omitting the base case, or writing the recursion step incorrectly so that it does not converge on the base case causes "indefinite" recursion, eventually exhausting memory. <STOP>
3.6 Either omitting the base case or writing the recursion step incorrectly so that it does not converge on the base case can cause an infinite recursion. <STOP>
3.6 Not having a base case that returns a base value. <STOP>
3.6 Incorrect or missing base case. <STOP> Must reduce to the base case. <STOP> The function must get simpler each time it is run -LRB- converge to the base case -RRB- . <STOP>
3.6 no base case no change in values. <STOP>
3.6 If at each recursive call the problem does not diminish or if it does not diminish to a base case, can cause infinite recursion. <STOP>
3.6 Omitting the base case or incorrectly calling the recursive step. <STOP>
3.6 The recursive problem cannot be reduced to reach the base case. <STOP>
3.6 Lack of defining a base case, or writing the recursion step incorrectly so that it does not converge on the base case <STOP>
3.6 Not having the proper case to leave the recursion <STOP>
3.6 no base case, or the recursive calls do not converge to the base case <STOP>
3.6 No base case, or an incorrectly written recursion step that does not converge on the base case will lead to infinite recursion. <STOP>
3.6 If the recursion function never reaches or successfully defines the base case it will recurse forever. <STOP> This happens many ways, such as the function does not progress towards the base case, or the function is coded poorly and does not even contain a base case. <STOP>
3.6 not creating a base case, or in the case where the base case will never be met. <STOP>
3.6 improper handling of cases such that not all possible values are able to be handled. <STOP>
3.6 There is no base case. <STOP> The recursion step does not reduce the problem during each recursive call. <STOP>
3.6 no base case, as in a single return that does not include calling the function again. a static value to end at. <STOP>
3.6 Either omitting the base case, or writing the recursion step incorrectly so the it does not reach the base case can cause infinite recursion. <STOP>
3.6 omitting the base case or writing the recursive call so that it does not converge upon the base case. <STOP>
3.6 Either omitting the base case, or writing the recursion step incorrectly so that it does not converge on the base case <STOP>
3.6 Infinite recursion may occur if no base case is defined or if the call is not varied. <STOP>
3.6 Not having a base case, or building a recursion process that does not converge on the base case. <STOP>
3.6 Either omitting the base case, or writing the recursion step incorerectly <STOP>
3.6 no base case or if the programmar does not define the base case as the simplest case and it never gets reached <STOP>
3.6 No easily reached base case and no base case at all <STOP>
3.6 function is never allowed to reach the "base case" <STOP>
3.6 it has no base case, or the base case is never met <STOP>
3.6 recursion refers to situations in which functions call themselves. <STOP> These types of functions are known as recursive functions. <STOP> That being said Infinite recursion occurs when the function is designed in such a way as to call it self forever without stopping possible causes <STOP>

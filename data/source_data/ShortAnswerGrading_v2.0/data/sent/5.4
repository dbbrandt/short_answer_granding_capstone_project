5.4 The base case for a recursive merge sort is one number. <STOP> One number by itself is a sorted list, regardless of what number it is. <STOP>
5.4 The base case for a recursive implementation of merge sort is when the sequence being passed to merge sort has less than 2 elements. <STOP>
5.4 The base case for a recursive implementation of merge sort is one. <STOP>
5.4 The best case is the same as the worst case O -LRB- n log n -RRB- for a recursive merge sort. <STOP>
5.4 there is one object in the split array to sort. <STOP>
5.4 The base case is when the length of the current array is 1. <STOP>
5.4 O -LRB- nlog -LRB- n -RRB- -RRB- <STOP>
5.4 Best case is one element. <STOP> One element is sorted. <STOP>
5.4 If the array being sorted has 0 or 1 elements <STOP>
5.4 T -LRB- n -RRB- equals 0, if n is less than 2. <STOP>
5.4 A list size of 1, where it is already sorted. <STOP>
5.4 Single element in the array <STOP>
5.4 O -LRB- nlog -LRB- n -RRB- -RRB- <STOP>
5.4 n multiplied by log -LRB- n -RRB- <STOP>
5.4 A list or array of only 1 element. <STOP>
5.4 where you only must merge sort once <STOP>
5.4 A single Element on the Array. <STOP>
5.4 There is only one element in the subarray. <STOP>
5.4 if the array length is less than or equal to 1, then that array is returned to the other array and merged together <STOP>
5.4 if -LRB- right is greater than left -RRB- mid equals -LRB- right plus left -RRB- divided by 2; m sort -LRB- numbers, temp, left, mid -RRB- ; m sort -LRB- numbers, temp, mid plus 1, right -RRB- ; merge -LRB- numbers, temp, left, mid plus 1, right -RRB- ; <STOP>
5.4 The sequence of numbers has zero or one elements. <STOP>
5.4 one element in an array <STOP>
5.4 array of length 1 <STOP>
5.4 the array has one element <STOP>
5.4 When there is only one element in the array, or when the starting element in the array is the same as the ending element. <STOP>
5.4 when each half or the original array has nothing else to sort, and puts the halfs back together <STOP>
5.4 the size of the list being sent is is less than or equal to 1 <STOP>
5.4 O -LRB- n log n -RRB- <STOP>

2.5 Just one per class. <STOP>
2.5 As many as you want so long as they have different parameters. <STOP>
2.5 There is no limit to the number of constructors in a class because like functions, constructors can be overloaded. <STOP>
2.5 It depends what type of class is being defined. <STOP> Typically you would have a constructor call for each object. <STOP>
2.5 In C plus plus, the constructor can be overloaded in that there can be more than one constructor for a class, each having different parameters. <STOP>
2.5 1 <STOP>
2.5 any number you want <STOP>
2.5 One <STOP>
2.5 by default just one, but they may be overloaded to create as many constructors as necessary <STOP>
2.5 as many as you want <STOP>
2.5 As many as you want, with different parameters. <STOP>
2.5 infinite <STOP>
2.5 as many as you need <STOP>
2.5 As many as are needed, depending on how many variables one wishes to directly modify or leave as default when instantiating an object. <STOP>
2.5 A very large amount of constructors can be created for any given class through overloading. <STOP> When two constructors with a different type or number of parameters are created, they are said to be overloaded, and C plus plus can recognize which constructor to use based on the type of the variables that are passed or returned. <STOP>
2.5 It depends on the number of objects. <STOP> Each object should have a constructor. <STOP>
2.5 Theoretically unlimited, as long as they are defined by the programmer. <STOP>
2.5 As many as needed. <STOP>
2.5 as many as wanted or needed <STOP>
2.5 several <STOP>
2.5 One <STOP>
2.5 one <STOP>
2.5 There can be infinite constructors as long as the signature is different. <STOP>
2.5 that depends on the number of data members in the class <STOP>
2.5 one <STOP>
2.5 you can overload constructors as you need <STOP>
2.5 As many as the programmer wants to create. <STOP>
2.5 one <STOP>
2.5 as many as you want, as long as they each have a unique argument list <STOP>
2.5 as many as the user decides to use. <STOP>

5.2 Searches an array for the largest or the smallest element and is moved out to the front of the array then it will search for the next largest or the smallest element to move out to the front <STOP>
5.2 Selection sort searches the whole array for the largest item and puts it at the end of the array, then searches for the second largest item and puts it at the second to last spot and so on. <STOP>
5.2 Finds the minimum value and swap it with the value in the first position. <STOP>
5.2 It finds the minimum element in the array and swaps it with the first element then repeats this step swapping the minimum element with nth positions in the array. <STOP>
5.2 Find the lowest value and place it at the front, then find the next lowest and place it in front of the last value, etc. <STOP>
5.2 Cycle through the unsorted list, place the minimum in the next slot in the sorted list, and repeat. <STOP>
5.2 find the minimum value in the list swap it with the first element in the list the find the second largest and swap it with the second element in the array continue like this until the array is sorted. <STOP>
5.2 Find the smallest and put it in the current position till you get to the end. <STOP>
5.2 Find the lowest unsorted value in the array and place it at the current position -LRB- starting at the first element in the array -RRB- and advance the "current" position by one. <STOP>
5.2 To sort the elements by comparing two elements and swapping the smaller one to sort the elements in the array. <STOP>
5.2 Selection sort finds the minimum value in the list, swaps it with the first value in the list, and repeats throughout the list. <STOP>
5.2 Select the minimum number from the array and put it in the current position, then move on <STOP>
5.2 Find the lowest value and place it in the front of the list and swap it with that value. <STOP> Continue moving right. <STOP>
5.2 The main idea behind selection sort is to take the least variable from the right and put it directly to the left. <STOP>
5.2 Find the smallest value in the list and make it the first element, then find the smallest value of the leftover list and make it the first element of the leftover list and continue until the list is sorted. <STOP>
5.2 It runs through and finds the lowest -LRB- or highest -RRB- value and puts it in its desired position. <STOP>
5.2 Places the smallest item in the list at position 1, and then proceeds to each value until the last position of the ray is reached. <STOP>
5.2 Search for the largest item in an array and swap it with the last unsorted item. <STOP>
5.2 finds the smallest element and places in 1st position. then the process is repeated on the rest of the array. <STOP>
5.2 Selection sort is an algorithm that selects the larges item the array and puts it in its place; then select the next largest until the array is sorted <STOP>
5.2 Select the smallest number in the list and move it to the front of the list and then advance to the next number. <STOP>
5.2 the selection sort chooses the largest or smallest value in an unsorted list and creates a new list using the selection depending on how it is sorted. <STOP>
5.2 Selection sort finds the smallest number left unsorted in an array, and puts it at the end of what it has sorted <STOP>
5.2 selects the minimum from the remaining elements of the array, and palces the miminum in the current position and moves to the next position <STOP>
5.2 To put the biggest element at the end of the list and place the next highest element behind it, and so on. <STOP>
5.2 the sort finds the largest item and places it at the end, then then next largest is found and placed next to last, continue until there is only one number left, this is the beginning of the sorted array <STOP>
5.2 you loop through the entire list, and for each iteration you find the smallest element and move it to the current position. <STOP>
5.2 Find the minimum value in the list swap it with the value in the first position; repeat the steps above for remainder of the list -LRB- starting in the second position. <STOP>

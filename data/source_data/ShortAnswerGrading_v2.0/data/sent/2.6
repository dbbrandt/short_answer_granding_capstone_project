2.6 A function definition does not require any additional information that needs to be passed inside its parenthesis to execute. <STOP> While a definition prototype requires more than one parameters to be passed in order to complete its task. <STOP>
2.6 The FUNCTION PROTOTYPE is where the programmer declares that he or she is using a function other than main -LRB- -RRB- . <STOP> This is like declaring a variable, the programmer knows that he or she will be using in the future, but has yet to say where they are going to use it, or how. <STOP> This is answers the question who, it gives the function a name and character. <STOP> The function prototype, by common practice is placed at the beginning of the program after the includes and before main -LRB- -RRB- . <STOP> The FUNCTION DEFINITION is the guts of the function. <STOP> This is where the programmer decides what the function is going to do and tells it how to do it. <STOP> It takes whatever information it is given and performs the operations. <STOP> It works sort of like the brain, the brain takes in input and based upon that input performs in some way producing an output. <STOP> The function defintion is placed outside of main -LRB- -RRB- and any other functions. <STOP> A function is its own entity and should be thought of as such. <STOP>
2.6 A function prototype tells the compiler the function name, return type and the number and type of parameters without revealing the implementations contained in the function definition. <STOP>
2.6 Function prototype is a declaration. <STOP> Function definitions -LRB- with multiple parameters -RRB- often require more than one piece of information. to perform their tasks. <STOP>
2.6 A function prototype is a declaration of a function that tells the compiler the function 's name, its return type and the types of its parameters. <STOP>
2.6 A prototype shows only return types and necessary parameters. <STOP> The definition includes names for those parameters and defines what the object is actually capable of doing. <STOP>
2.6 prototype only tells the user what data types go into a function and what type is returned. <STOP>
2.6 Function prototype is located in the. h file and only contains the access function name and paramater type. <STOP> Function definition contains the code for the function to perform its activity. <STOP>
2.6 a function prototype is used to reference the compiler to a function that will be defined later on, a function definition is the actual function itself, complete with return type, parameters, etc ... <STOP>
2.6 A function prototype describes a class 's public interface without revealing the class 's member function implementations <STOP>
2.6 Function definitions are just that, the definition. <STOP> The prototype is what the compiler uses to check that calls to function are correct. <STOP>
2.6 a prototype does not include any actual code where the function has all the code that is executed in the program. <STOP>
2.6 a prototype declares what will be used in the program and the definition <STOP>
2.6 A function prototype lays out the name, return type, and the number and types of parameters the function expects to receive in a certain order. <STOP> The details for function prototypes are in the function definition. <STOP>
2.6 A function definition is the code that defines the function placed in the brackets that determines that function 's operation. <STOP> A function prototype shows the function 's public interface without exposing implementation. <STOP> It shows name, return type and type of paramaters. <STOP>
2.6 A function prototype is just a declaration of the function existing, and cant be used as an actual function. <STOP> A function has to be created with a definition within to tell the compiler what the function does. <STOP>
2.6 the Prototype creates a framework to call the function definition. <STOP> While a function definition is where the function is actually programmed out and created into a final product. <STOP>
2.6 A function prototype describes the class 's public interface without providing how the function works. <STOP> A function definition contains the inner workings of the function. <STOP>
2.6 prototype states all functions in that class before compilation, where the definition actually holds the source for the functions <STOP>
2.6 Function prototypes tell the compiler the function names, its return type, and the types of its parameters where as, function definitions actually implement the member functions. <STOP>
2.6 A function prototype just specifies parameters. <STOP> A function definition includes parameters and a code body. <STOP>
2.6 Function prototypes describe the class 's public interface <STOP>
2.6 A prototype only declares name, return type, and input type. <STOP> A definition also defines the scope, variables, process, and return function <STOP>
2.6 a function prototype simply declares the functions parameters, the function definition includes any necessary variables and the function 's actual code <STOP>
2.6 A functgion prototype is a declaration of a function, while function definition specifies what a function does <STOP>
2.6 in a function prototype you include the return type, the name of the function, and its parameters if any are needed. in a function definition you write the code of what the function will do. <STOP>
2.6 A function definition contains all the code for a function to work. <STOP> A function prototype just shows the output, input and function name. <STOP>
2.6 function prototype describe the class 's public interface without revealing the class 's member function implementations, function definitions show what implementations are being done <STOP>
2.6 A function prototype only names the function, its return type, and it is argument list, while a definition defines the above as well as what the function actually does. <STOP>
2.6 function prototype describes a classes interface without reviling whatever is inside as for the function definition cannot do that. <STOP>

8.1 A data structure for storing items which are to be accessed in last-in first-out order that can be implemented in three ways. <STOP>
8.1 A stack is an abstract data type that is based on the principle that the last element inserted into the stack will be the first element removed from the stack. <STOP>
8.1 Stores a set of elements in a particular order. <STOP>
8.1 An ADT whose most recently inserted item is the first item removed or retrieved. <STOP> This property is called last in, first out -LRB- LIFO -RRB- . <STOP> Items enter and leave a stack at its top. <STOP>
8.1 A list in which only the top -LRB- or last item added -RRB- can be modified. <STOP>
8.1 a stack is a data structure that uses push to insert an item and pop to remove ad item. <STOP> The stack use a last in first out structure for inserting and removing items. <STOP>
8.1 A data structure that stores data using LIFO. <STOP>
8.1 A stack is similar to an array, but does not allow for random access. <STOP> Stacks only allow a user to retrieve the last item put into the stack. <STOP> Last in, fist out. <STOP>
8.1 Stores a set of elements in a particular order. <STOP> Stack principle: LAST IN FIRST OUT. <STOP> It means: the last element inserted is the first one to be removed. <STOP>
8.1 A stack is an ADT that stores a set of elements in a particular order. <STOP>
8.1 a data type that stores a set of elements in a certain order, last in, first out. <STOP>
8.1 a data structure that moves elements in last in first out <STOP>
8.1 Stores a set of elements in a last in first out order. <STOP>
8.1 A list that can be added to or removed from only from the top. <STOP>
8.1 a stack is an Abstract data type which operates on a last in first out basis for storing a list of objects, and does not support -LRB- at least in the pure stack -RRB- peeking at a element without removing the rest of the stack first. <STOP>
8.1 Stores a set of elements in a particular order based on the principle of Last In First Out -LRB- LIFO -RRB- . <STOP>
8.1 an object list that stores elements in a particular order, the first object inserted is at the bottom with the last object at the top so the first object in is the last object out. <STOP>
8.1 An ADT that stores a set of elements in a particular order. <STOP> The stack principles are LIFO. <STOP> The last item inserted in the list is the first out. <STOP>
8.1 An abstract data type that stores a set of elements in a particular order. <STOP>
8.1 a collection of data to be executed in the order of last in first out <STOP>
8.1 A stack is a data structure that allows data members to be added or removed one at a time, and in order. <STOP> They are a "Last in First Out" structure. <STOP>
8.1 Stores a set of element in a particular order <STOP>
8.1 is a list of element where the first one to be removed is the last one inserted <STOP>
8.1 A data structure that puts elements in a list and only allows the user access to the last element. <STOP>
8.1 a finite ordered list with zero or more elements <STOP>
8.1 A storage container that holds objects in a certain order, which has a LIFO priority <STOP>
8.1 Stacks are a type of container adaptors, specifically designed to operate in a LIFO context -LRB- last-in first-out -RRB- , where elements are inserted and extracted only from the end of the container. <STOP>

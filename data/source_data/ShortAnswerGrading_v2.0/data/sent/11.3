11.3 ie. <STOP> GradeBook myGradeBook -LRB- -RRB- ; call upon the class and then give it a name like shown <STOP>
11.3 They are initialized as a named instance of the template formed by the class. <STOP> This named instance can then be modified to be different from the class that it was created from. <STOP>
11.3 not answered <STOP>
11.3 Objects are initialized by a value given. <STOP> When an object is defined for a certain task. <STOP>
11.3 They are initialized with a ". <STOP> " <STOP> -LRB- dot -RRB- between the constructor and the object being created. <STOP>
11.3 objectname classname -LRB- -RRB- ; to call a function from the class: objectname. funciton -LRB- -RRB- ; <STOP>
11.3 If the object refers to a class, the constructor -LRB- s -RRB- will initialize the objects based on return type and parameters passed. <STOP> Compiler will auto-create one if one is not provided. <STOP>
11.3 classname objectname -LRB- input parameters -RRB- ; <STOP>
11.3 When the class is called by the Constructor <STOP>
11.3 Constructors; default when not provided by user, or programmer specified constructors. <STOP>
11.3 Objects are usually initialized at the beginning of the program and are initialized usually in the main function. <STOP> They are initialized after the class 's name. <STOP>
11.3 ; or, if you want to initialize a variable to a certain value, equals; <STOP>
11.3 variables are set to a given value, or 0 if none is given. <STOP>
11.3 When the object is initialized, its constructor is called -LRB- whether one is provided or c plus plus assigns a default constructor -RRB- . <STOP>
11.3 Objects are initialized essentially as copies of the corresponding classes, complete with their own separate variables. <STOP>
11.3 If you had a class Gradebook, you would initialize it in your main function by use of a constructor in the Gradebook class. <STOP> If no constructor is specified or found, c plus plus will use a default one with no parameters. <STOP> Gradebook myGradebook; <STOP> In this bit of code, the class Gradebook has been initialized as object myGradebook. <STOP>
11.3 objects are initialized by stating the classname first then assigning a name to the object. <STOP> Within the object 's -LRB- -RRB- is a place where it can be initialized. <STOP>
11.3 They are initialized with a constructor. <STOP>
11.3 The value is specified after declaration, It can initialized anywhere between the declaration and the corresponding. <STOP>
11.3 with the default constructor for that object in its class. if no constructor is specified, it uses the default system constructor. <STOP>
11.3 initialized using the same name as the class <STOP>
11.3 they are initialized to a value dependent on the compiler <STOP>
11.3 memory is allocated in accordance with their type and initialization input. <STOP>
11.3 Objects are assigned a space in memory when they are created. the name given to the object points to the memory address where the objects data resides. <STOP>
11.3 using constructor <STOP>
11.3 by giving them a value <STOP>
11.3 By declaring the class first, the name of the variable, and then any variables that need to be put in the constructor. <STOP> Ex. <STOP> Class myClass -LRB- x, y -RRB- <STOP>
11.3 objects are initialized by giving the object a type, name, and initial value <STOP>
11.3 they are initialized to 0 <STOP>
11.3 obj. are initialized by the variables that call them, when they are created within a class. e. i. classname objectname etc. <STOP>

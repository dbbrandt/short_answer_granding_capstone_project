6.4 The array itself can be signed to a pointer or each element of the array can be assigned to a pointer. <STOP>
6.4 An array can be addressed in pointer or offset notation by setting a pointer variable equal to the variable name of the array. <STOP> Elements of the array can then be accessed by adding an offset value to the pointer variable. <STOP>
6.4 Element b [n] can be accessed by multiplied by -LRB- bPtr plus n -RRB- . <STOP>
6.4 Using either the name of the array as a pointer or using a separate pointer that points to the array. <STOP>
6.4 An element b [3] can be referenced by using multiplied by -LRB- bPtr plus 3 -RRB- instead. <STOP>
6.4 you get the memory location of the first element and the you add an offset to it to get other elements. <STOP>
6.4 yes multiplied by -LRB- array plus offset -RRB- <STOP>
6.4 The name of an array is considered to be a pointer in C plus plus, and can be passed as such in functions parameters. <STOP> Declaring int a [10]; creates a pointer "a" which stores the address of a [0]. <STOP>
6.4 Element b [n] can be accessed by multiplied by -LRB- bPtr plus n -RRB- is an example of how an array can be addressed as pointer or offset notation. <STOP>
6.4 multiplied by -LRB- array plus element -RRB- <STOP>
6.4 multiplied by f [3] <STOP>
6.4 you can have a pointer to the front of the array and add to the memory location -LRB- or offset from the initial value -RRB- . <STOP>
6.4 The pointer to the array will initially point to the first element of that array. <STOP> When the pointer is incremented, it will point to the next element, and so on. <STOP>
6.4 With int x [10]; int star of xPtr; xPtr equals x; <STOP> Address address of x [1] is the same as xPtr plus 1. <STOP>
6.4 Takes the number of array elements and points to each at a time <STOP>
6.4 The array can act as a pointer or be referenced by a pointer. multiplied by -LRB- arrayPtr plus 3 -RRB- or multiplied by -LRB- array plus 3 -RRB- <STOP>
6.4 by using the multiplied by -LRB- pointer plus element-index -RRB- <STOP>
6.4 using the star operator. array: b [n] can be accessed by multiplied by -LRB- bpointer plus n -RRB- <STOP>
6.4 Element A [n] can be accessed by multiplied by -LRB- APtr plus n -RRB- <STOP>
6.4 by referencing a pointer and referring to other pointers relative to the first pointer -LRB- pointer plus 1, pointer plus 2, etc -RRB- <STOP>
6.4 First, some pointer variable must reference the first entity in the array. <STOP> Any variable in the array can then be accessed by referring to that first entity 's address plus some offset. i. e. ptrToArray equals array; nthEntity equals multiplied by -LRB- ptrToArray plus n -RRB- ; <STOP>
6.4 ADDRESS [b 3] is as bptr plus 3. <STOP> Array can be treated as pointer <STOP>
6.4 a [i] equals multiplied by -LRB- a plus i -RRB- <STOP>
6.4 address of b [3] bPtr plus 3 <STOP>
6.4 multiplied by -LRB- arrayName plus index -RRB- <STOP>
6.4 multi-dimensional array <STOP>

7.1 Consists of sequence of nodes, each containing a number of data fields and one or two links called pointers that point to the next or previous nodes. <STOP>
7.1 A linked list is a list in which each item in the list points to the next item in the list. <STOP>
7.1 A linked list is a chain of structs or records called nodes and you have the ability to add, delete, or retrieve items. <STOP>
7.1 A list of elements, or nodes, that are linked to one another such that each element points to the next element. <STOP>
7.1 A sequence of nodes, each containing data fields -LRB- specified by programmer -RRB- and pointer -LRB- s -RRB- which can point to the next or previous nodes. <STOP>
7.1 a list of nodes where each node contains a data member and also a pointer to the next node. <STOP>
7.1 A list of items linked together. <STOP> Each item is linked to its successor. <STOP>
7.1 A linked list is a chain of nodes that each store a single piece of data and pointer variables that point to other nodes in the list. <STOP>
7.1 one of the fundamental data structures, and can be used to implement other data structures. <STOP> It consists of a sequence of nodes, each containing arbitrary data fields and one or two references -LRB- "links" <STOP> -RRB- pointing to the next and previous nodes. <STOP>
7.1 A data structure in a sequence of nodes, each containing arbitrary data fields and one or two references -LRB- "links" <STOP> -RRB- pointing to the next and previous nodes. <STOP>
7.1 Information in memory linked to the next piece of information and can only be linked forwards and not backwards. <STOP>
7.1 A linked list is a data structure that is not necessarily in the same contiguous memory space -LRB- such as arrays -RRB- . <STOP> It holds the data type and points to the next data item in the list, or in a doubly linked list also to the previous item. <STOP>
7.1 A linked list is a data structure containing one or more data elements with a pointer to the next node. <STOP>
7.1 A series of "Nodes" structures with a value and a pointer that point to a similar "Node". <STOP> Not quite an array, but still can carry a list of values. <STOP>
7.1 A data type that contains a pointer to at least the next element in a list. <STOP>
7.1 Each component contains a Node a data item and a pointer to the next item in the list <STOP>
7.1 A linked list is a chain of structs or records called nodes. <STOP> Each node has at least two members, one of which points to the next item or node in the list. <STOP>
7.1 An array based list that uses an implicit ordering scheme, often using pointers. <STOP>
7.1 a series of structures containing data items and a pointer that links the structure to the next structure. <STOP>
7.1 A linked list is a collection of Objects each containing at least one data member, and a pointer to the next object in the list -LRB- and the previous object in the case of a doubly linked list -RRB- <STOP>
7.1 A link list is a data structure which is built from structures and pointers. <STOP> It forms a chain of nodes with pointers representing the links of the chain and holding the entire thing together <STOP>
7.1 its a list of pointers that are linked 2 each other. every pointer points to the next pointer which has the next element <STOP>
7.1 linear collection of self-referential nodes connected by pointers. <STOP>
7.1 the items of a data structure are linked to each other using pointers <STOP>
7.1 A list of objects where each object contains a link to the next item in the list <STOP>
7.1 A linked list is one of the fundamental data structures, and can be used to implement other data structures. <STOP> It consists of a sequence of nodes, each containing arbitrary data fields and one or two references -LRB- "links" <STOP> -RRB- pointing to the next and previous nodes. <STOP>

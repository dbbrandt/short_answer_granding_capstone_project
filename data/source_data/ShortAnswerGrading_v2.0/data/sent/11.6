11.6 Iteration, performers a series of checks and loops. <STOP>
11.6 The alternative method is to use loops in the program instead of a function which calls itself. <STOP>
11.6 An alternative to solving a problem using recursive functions is to solve the problem using iteration. <STOP>
11.6 Iteration, this would be more efficient and has repetition structure. <STOP>
11.6 One can use iteration or by using a simple while or for loop. <STOP>
11.6 iteration <STOP>
11.6 Iteration. <STOP> A while loop or a for loop will be able to accomplish the same desired outcome ... It may be faster than recursion, but could also be harder to understand. <STOP>
11.6 you can also solve the problem iteratively <STOP>

11.6 Another alternative way to solve a problem instead of using recursive functions is by using iteration. <STOP>
11.6 A recursive function can often be solved using an iterative function, which runs faster, but is often more complicated. <STOP>

11.6 Any recursive function can be solved using an iterative method. <STOP>
11.6 Many recursive solutions may also be solved with looping control statements, such as while, for, do-while, etc. <STOP>

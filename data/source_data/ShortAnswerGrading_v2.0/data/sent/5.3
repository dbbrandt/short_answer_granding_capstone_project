5.3 The run time for this sorting program is n to the power of 2. Best case is the list is already sorted, worst case is the list is sorted but in reverse. <STOP>
5.3 Insertion sort is O -LRB- n -RRB- and performs n minus 1 operations in the best-case scenario, which is when the list or array is already sorted. <STOP>
5.3 The number of operations for insertions sort, under best-case, is n -LRB- n minus 1 -RRB- divided by 2. The best case for insertion sort is on a sorted list where it runs is O -LRB- n -RRB- . <STOP>
5.3 Best case would be O -LRB- n -RRB- or n minus 1, because that is what it takes to scan the array and make one swap. <STOP> The array would then be sorted and would take only 1 operation. <STOP>
5.3 Best case-1 <STOP> Worst Case-N <STOP>
5.3 It will do -LRB- n -RRB- operations where -LRB- n -RRB- is the number of elements in the array. <STOP> Best case is when all the elements are already sorted. <STOP>
5.3 O -LRB- n -RRB- <STOP>
5.3 Best case is all elements sorted. n minus 1. <STOP>
5.3 The best case scenario for an insertion sort, where all the elements of the array have been already sorted, will cause the for loop to iterate "x" times -LRB- "x" being the number of elements in the array -RRB- and the while loop to never have to iterate, resulting in the insertion sort to require "x" operations. <STOP>
5.3 1 operation. the best case scenario s where it is already sorted and does one comparision. <STOP>
5.3 n operations, where n is the number of items. <STOP>
5.3 n minus 1 <STOP>
5.3 O -LRB- n -RRB- , the list is already sorted. <STOP>
5.3 Insertion sort will take n minus 1 operations if the array is in reverse order. <STOP>
5.3 In the best case scenario of an already sorted list, insertion sort will progress once through the list. <STOP> So the number of operations is directly proportional to the number of elements in the list. <STOP> Also noted as O -LRB- n -RRB- in big o notation. <STOP>
5.3 1 where there is a list of two ints and only one must be moved. <STOP>
5.3 Best case is N, while the worst case is N factorial. <STOP>
5.3 n minus 1 <STOP> The best case is when the array is already sorted. <STOP>
5.3 worst case its equals O -LRB- n -RRB- time best case its equals O -LRB- n to the power of 2 -RRB- time <STOP>
5.3 O -LRB- n -RRB- <STOP>
5.3 N number of times. <STOP> Where N equals the number of elements in the list. <STOP> Best-case scenario is that the elements in the list are already sorted. <STOP>
5.3 the best case scenario for insertion sort is a list that is already sorted. the number of operations would be the same as the number of elements <STOP>
5.3 insertion sort will make zero operations -LRB- and length 1 comparisons -RRB- in the best case scenario, that is, when the array its given is already in order. <STOP>
5.3 theta -LRB- n -RRB- the best case senario is that everything is already sorted <STOP>
5.3 n operations <STOP> The best case scenario is when all the numbers are in increasing order. <STOP>
5.3 it could be considered that having only one item would be the easiest to sort, but this could also be a trivial result as nothing is moved having two items allows the algorithm to sort the items into the correct order <STOP>
5.3 the best case is if it only has to look through the list once. <STOP> The best case scenario is when it goes through the list and does not have to make any changes -LRB- the list is already sorted -RRB- <STOP>
5.3 very simplistic it moves one element from the list by one and inserting them in their correct position into a new slot then starting over. best case is -LRB- 0 -RRB- 1 <STOP>

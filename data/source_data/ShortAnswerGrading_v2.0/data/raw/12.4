12.4 it scans the list and selects the smallest(largest) element and places it in the front, increment the curPtr by one, scan the list again for the next smallest(largest) element and place it in with respect with the other sorted elements.
12.4 Selection sort searches the array for the lowest value and swaps it with the first value in the array. Then searches for the next lowest value and swaps it with the second item in the array, and so on.
12.4 Compare the largest element to the front element and swap data according to value if needed.
12.4 Selection sort is a sorting algorithm that divides a list in half and has two lists. It then compares the first elements in both these lists and puts these elements in another list, having the smaller element before the bigger one.
12.4 Iterate through the list (assume list of integers), find the smallest one, and put it in a separate "sorted" list... then traverse again and find the next smallest, and move it to the sorted section... and repeat until you run out of elements to sort.
12.4 selection sort selects the smallest element out of the list then the second smallest ....and sorts them acordingly.
12.4 You select the smallest element and place it on the left.  You select the smallest element and sort it with respect the the item already on the left.  You continue this till the end of the collection of items.
12.4 A selection sort scrolls through the data structure looking for the lowest (or highest) unsorted piece of data, moves it to the held spot, increments that spot by one, and starts the process over.
12.4 Selection sort works by finding the smallest element and then compares it with the largest and sorts the elements.
12.4 Selection sort is usually a recursive sorting method where you divide the elements to be sorted in half repeatedly. You then sort the smallest case, then work your way up, sorting each until they are all sorted.
12.4 goes to the middle of the list, checks to see if it is greater or less then the value given and moves through the list accordingly to add the value into the proper place.
12.4 selection sort finds the lowest element in the data set and places it behind the pivot point.
12.4 Selection sort iterates through the array one element at a time, seeking the least value from the right and replacing the current value with it.
12.4 Selection sort traverses an unsorted array looking for the smallest value, when it's found it is put at the beginning of the unsorted array.  Performed several times, this will output a sorted array.
12.4 it runs through the list and finds the smallest (or largest) value and puts it at the appropriate position
12.4 pick a number, and set all values less than that number to the left, while all numbers on the right of that number is larger.
12.4 It takes the largest item in the unsorted array and swaps it with last item in the unsorted array.
12.4 by selecting the first object and comparing it with the next objects to find one that is smaller, if it does it switches the two.  then it comes back the other way and sees if the objects previous to the last one is greater, if it does it switches them.  it does this while decreasing the range it looks at until it finishes in the middle.
12.4 Selection sorts works by going through a certain list. Goes through the unsorted list and selecting the largest item in the list and placing it in a sorted array. There are two arrays, unsorted and sorted. Complete these steps until the list is sorted.
12.4 selection sort works by pulling all of the values off to the side, leaving one value in the list.  It will then insert a value into the list.  if the value is bigger it will go to the right, if smaller if will go to the left.
12.4 selection sort searches for the smallest element of the remaining data organization and places it at the largest point of the new data organization
12.4 Selection sort sorts an array one element at at time. It first finds the element with the smallest key and puts it into the first location within its array or list, then finds the next smallest and puts it in the second location, and so on.
12.4 select an element compare it with 2nd element if it is greater, swap it 
12.4 it selects the smallest element in a list and switches it with the element in its correct position, then it selects the next smallest and does the same...
12.4 It starts at the first element and replaces it with the smallest element found to the right. It then repeats with the next element in the list.
12.4 selection sort is when you pick a data member and put it in a new array, then you pick another data member and put it in order with the new array, then pick another and insert it in the correct place in the new array, etc etc
12.4 it searches through the entire data set for the best element to go in the current position, then it moves up a position and searches through the remainder of the set for the best element for the new position.
12.4 selection sort  iterates through the array one element @ a time searching for the right and replacing current value with it.

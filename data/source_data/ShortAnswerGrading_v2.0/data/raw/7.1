7.1 Consists of sequence of nodes, each containing a number of data fields and one or two links called pointers that point to the next or previous nodes.<br>
7.1 A linked list is a list in which each item in the list points to the next item in the list.
7.1 A linked list is a chain of structs or records called nodes and you have the ability to add, delete, or retrieve items. 
7.1 A list of elements, or nodes, that are linked to one another such that each element points to the next element.
7.1 A sequence of nodes, each containing data fields (specified by programmer) and pointer(s) which can point to the next or previous nodes.
7.1 a list of nodes where each node contains a data member and also a pointer to the next node.
7.1 A list of items linked together.  Each item is linked to its successor.
7.1 A linked list is a chain of nodes that each store a single piece of data and pointer variables that point to other nodes in the list.
7.1 one of the fundamental data structures, and can be used to implement other data structures. It consists of a sequence of nodes, each containing arbitrary data fields and one or two references ("links") pointing to the next and/or previous nodes. 
7.1 A data structure in a sequence of nodes, each containing arbitrary data fields and one or two references ("links") pointing to the next and/or previous nodes.
7.1 Information in memory linked to the next piece of information and can only be linked forwards and not backwards.
7.1 A linked list is a data structure that is not necessarily in the same contiguous memory space (such as arrays). It holds the data type and points to the next data item in the list, or in a doubly linked list also to the previous item.
7.1 A linked list is a data structure containing one or more data elements with a pointer to the next node.
7.1 A series of "Nodes" structures with a value and a pointer that point to a similar "Node". Not quite an array, but still can carry a list of values. 
7.1 A data type that contains a pointer to at least the next  element in a list.
7.1 Each component contains a Node - a data item and a pointer to the next item in the list
7.1 A linked list is a chain of structs or records called nodes.  Each node has at least two members, one of which points to the next item or node in the list.
7.1 An array based list that uses an implicit ordering scheme, often using pointers.
7.1 a series of structures containing data items and a pointer that links the structure to the next structure.
7.1 A linked list is a collection of Objects each containing at least one data member, and a pointer to the next object in the list (and the previous object in the case of a doubly linked list)
7.1 A link list is a data structure which is built from structures and pointers. It forms a chain of nodes with pointers representing the links of the chain and holding the entire thing together
7.1 its a list of pointers that are linked 2 each other. every pointer points to the next pointer which has the next element
7.1 linear collection of self-referential nodes connected by pointers.
7.1 the items of a data structure are linked to each other using pointers
7.1 A list of objects where each object contains a link to the next item in the list
7.1 A linked list is one of the fundamental data structures, and can be used to implement other data structures. It consists of a sequence of nodes, each containing arbitrary data fields and one or two references ("links") pointing to the next and/or previous nodes.

11.8 the type char[] has a  null ('\n' ) element at the very end.
11.8 a variable char is basically any non command key on the keyboard that you can press. A string is a collection of letters or numbers that is stored together to be used later. Comonly strings are used for words. Chars can be used for less but can have opperations performed on them in a useful way.
11.8 The programmer must provide the null terminating character in a string of characters using type char[] and must also ensure that the array is large enough to contain the input string of characters and the null terminating character.
11.8 String of characters are followed by a null statement.  type string is for example <br><br>string s;
11.8 String contains a word where as char can contain phrases or a string of characters.
11.8 a string is a variable with a single entinty of letters combined into one while in a char[] each letter is assigned a memory value and each has its own variable assigned i.e. char[0] char[1].
11.8 A string contains a null character at the end of the string, which makes it easily possible to get the string length. A char array can have a virtually unlimited length, therefore, its size must be declared/limited.
11.8 an array of characters stores a null character at the end
11.8 When you read a string of characters, you also read in the white space.  When you read characters declared char you only read the characters, no white space.
11.8 Character arrays will terminate at any whitespace, including spaces. Strings terminate when they encounter the new line character.
11.8 The difference is that a string that is declared a variable of type char[] is each char is included in the array versus the string of characters that is read into a variable.
11.8 An array of strings reads the string literals, meaning anything within "quotes". A char array reads a string as each individual character.
11.8 character arrays can call on individual letters were a string array can only call words.
11.8 The character array has an end of line character at the end of it.
11.8 Type char[] may contain a null value as the last element, whereas type string will not.
11.8 The variable of type string has a terminating character \0 at the end of it.
11.8 the one that is type string has an extra string member. The /0 at the end. 
11.8 a string has variable size and function calls available, while an character array usually has a static size.
11.8 a string char[] adds a null value to the end of the string.
11.8 char array needs an end character signature and is made up of characters each separate from each other, a string is an object in itself, with a value that the user enters.
11.8 the variable of type char[], each character is stored into a different memory address and can be accessed easly, where as in a string of character, its not easy to be able to access each character in the string.
11.8 When the string is passed into the array char, individual characters are stored and can be manipulated.  Although when a word is stored into a string variable, it is stored as one word and not as individual characters.
11.8 a string variable can change in size and is passed to functions by value, whereas a type char[] cannot change in size and is passed to functions by reference only
11.8 A string type string acts as a single object, with individual char entities accessible only through specific string class functions.<br>A char array is less robust, but allows direct access to specific char entities.
11.8 In arrays strings are stored as a characters (char[]), each character of string will be stored in each memory location of the array, while string of characters is only one memory location.
11.8 an array of characters has one more element, its last element,the terminating element, or null, which doesnt exist in a variable of type string
11.8 A string of characters is a specific variable type that has no extra data at the end. A string of type char[] is all the characters and a null ('\0')
11.8 a string of characters will have a null character or value at the end of the string
11.8 when the characters are put in a char array, there is also a null terminating character added to the end, '\0'
11.8 string of characters that is read into a variable of type string includes,

7.6 they can traverse in both directions
7.6 In a doubly linked list you can delete a node without having to traverse the list.
7.6 A doubly-linked list allows you to delete a node without traversing the list to establish a trailing pointer.
7.6 A doubly linked list allows you to traverse the list in either direction. Each node points to its successor as well as to its predecessor. 
7.6 Doubly-linked lists can traverse backwards, though they still cannot access data at any point in the list, it can be shorter to traverse backwards.
7.6 you can traverse the list from front to back and back to front
7.6 You can traverse the list in reverse.
7.6 Doubly linked lists can be traversed in both directions
7.6 Double-linked lists require more space per node, and their elementary operations are more expensive; but they are often easier to manipulate because they allow sequential access to the list in both directions.
7.6 You can traverse forwards and backwards through nodes. 
7.6 You can point both forwards and backwards
7.6 You can go backwards in the linked list and access previous data easier without having to keep track of the previous item
7.6 Doubly linked lists allow backward movement through the nodes.
7.6 they have double pointers, so each node can point forwards or backwards. Making it a little easer to get to where you need. 
7.6  ability to backtrack through a list.
7.6 You can move forwards and backwards in the double-linked list. Basic only moves forwards.
7.6 The advantage is that each node points to bothe its predecessor and its successor. There are no special cases for insertion and deletion.
7.6 each node points to both its predecessor and its successor.
7.6 a doubly linked list has pointers in both directions. this allows for access from back to front as well as front to back
7.6 A doubly linked list can be traversed either direction, while a normal linked list can only be traversed from start to finish
7.6 Double Linked list are often easier to manipulate, because they allow sequential access to the list in both direction
7.6 given a node in the list, one can navigate easily in either direction
7.6 You can traverse the list both forward and backwards.
7.6 a doubly linked list allows you to back up from a node rather than having to go through the entire list again<br>
7.6 Gives faster times for some operations such as insertion and deletion
7.6 The primary disadvantage of doubly linked lists are that (1) each node requires an extra pointer, requiring more space, and (2) the insertion or deletion of a node takes a bit longer (more pointer operations).

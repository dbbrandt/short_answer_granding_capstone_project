11.5 A function that calls upon it self to solve a problem.  Each time it calls upon it self it splits up a problem into a simplier form until it reaches a 'base case' which is the most simplest form of the problem.
11.5 A function that calls itself to perform an opperation such as a factorial recursive function.
11.5 not answered
11.5 A base case that calls upon itself until the problem becomes smaller and terminates.
11.5 It's a function that calls itself. It runs multiple times until the base case is reached.
11.5 a function that calls itself untill it reaches a base case.
11.5 A function that calls itself. Each time it does, it must get smaller, and eventually MUST converge to a base case, otherwise you can start an infinite loop.
11.5 a function that calls itself until a base case is met
11.5 A function that calls itself. With each function call the problem is diminished.
11.5 A function that calls itself to perform a certain task
11.5 A recursive function is a function that calls itself. Usually called the base case. If the base case is not correct it causes a infinite loop.
11.5 A function that calls itself, in order to solve a problem.
11.5 a function that calls itself over and over until it finds the simplest form of solution, or the base case.
11.5 A recursive function is a function that calls itself repeatedly until a base case is achieved. The fundamental idea is to break one large problem into a series of smaller, similar problems.
11.5 A recursive function typically simplifies a problem by calling itself, until arriving at a base case, at which it recursively returns a solution.
11.5 A recursive function is a function that breaks down a large problem into two or more smaller problems and calls itself to solve those smaller problems until a base case or terminating point is reached.  At the base case, a definite answer is called and the function no longer recurses, but unwinds itself back through function calls to determine the answer to the original large problem.
11.5 a function that calls itself into a loop with a base case for a loop exit.
11.5 a function that calls itself until the base cases are met.
11.5 A recursive function only knows how to solve base cases<br><br>A recursive function calls itself directly or indirectly until a base case is reached.
11.5 a function that calls on itself and uses a base case to stop the recursion
11.5 a function that calls itself, and which eaach calls get closer and close to the base case.
11.5 A function that divides and conquers a problem.  There is a base case that will eventually be reached.  The function calls itself over and over until the base case is satisfied.
11.5 a function that calls itself in the definition code
11.5 A recursive function solves a problem by repeatedly calling itself. the initial problem is broken into successively smaller parts until a much simpler base case is reached. the solutions to each piece of the problem are then returned a step at a time.
11.5 It invoke by itself again ana again, unless it reach bas case
11.5 a function that solves a problem by dividing the problem into smaller problems, by calling its self again and again, until a base case is reached.
11.5 A function that calls itself over and over again till a base case is reached, then it returns back to the original function.
11.5 a recursive function is a function that during execution, calls itself over and over until a base case is reached
11.5 A function that calls itself. Usually used to split a problem into several smaller problems of the same type.
11.5 function that calls it self till the base case is met

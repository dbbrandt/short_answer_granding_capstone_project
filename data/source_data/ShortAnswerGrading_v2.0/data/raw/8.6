8.6 They are converted to post fix expressions.  It still follow the order of precedence for the operators.
8.6 They are first converted to postfix expressions and then evaluated.
8.6 Computers cannot evaulate infix expressions, it must first convert infix to postfix expression then it can evaluate.
8.6 By using parentheses to have order in the expression.
8.6 In postfix notation.
8.6 computers usually convert infix expressions to post fix expression and evaluate them using a stack.
8.6 they are converted to postfix
8.6 Infix expressions are interpreted as postfix expressions by implementing stacks.
8.6 They are first converted into an equivalent postfix expression so it can be read by the computer.
8.6 The computer translates the infix expression to a postfix expression, then solves.
8.6 in postfix format
8.6 they use parenthisis and a stack to determine which evaluations need to be made first
8.6 By throwing variables into a postfix expression and operands onto a parentheses regulated stack until end parentheses and enough variables to operate on are encountered. 
8.6 by being passed to the function by a leading term
8.6 i have an hard time explaining this so i'll show how infix is evaluated instead.<br>Start with an infix expression, like, <br>(((5+2)*5)+(400/(2+3))), and  push items until you get a ")" and once that happens, perform the operations until you reach an "("... with that complete, you will now have <br>((7*5)+(400/(2+3))) as now the expression that will be evaluated... perform last step again...<br>(35+(400/(2+3))) is now the stack.... repeat agian...<br>(35+(400/5)) is now the stack after that.... repeat...<br>(35+80) is now the stack, repeat again...<br>115 is now the stack, and is returned.
8.6 The infix expression is converted to postfix form<br>
8.6 by converting them to postfix expressions and putting the operations in a stack
8.6 The computer converts the infix expression to postfix form. Then evaluates the postfix expression.
8.6 infix expressions are converted to postfix expressions before they can be evaluated by a computer.  Operands stay in the same order.  Operators always follow the operands.
8.6 infix expressions are pointers evaluated by reference to the memory location
8.6 computers convert infix expressions to postfix form before evaluation
8.6 convert infix expressions to postfix expression and evaluate the postfix expression
8.6 When an operand is entered, the computer<br>Pushes it onto a stack<br>When an operator is entered, the computer<br>Applies it to the top two operands of the stack<br>Pops the operands from the stack<br>Pushes the result of the operation onto the stack
8.6 Computers convert an infix expression into a postfix expression. They then push the numbers onto a stack and pop them out as they are needed.
8.6 infix expressions are converted to postfix, (i.e. 3+2 is changed to 32+)
8.6 they are transformed into post-fix expressions, then evaluated with a stack.
8.6 Writing arithmetic expressions is called infix notation.  This is because a binary operator (like '+') is written in between its two operands (as in "a + b").  There are two alternative forms of notation used in certain situations.  One is prefix notation, in which an operator is written before its operands.  In prefix notation, the sum of a and b is written "+ a b".  This is the notation used to write function calls in mathematics and computer science.  It is also used in the Lisp and Scheme programming languages.  In postfix notation, an operator is written after its operands.  The sum of a and b is written "a b +".  (You may have seen this as "reverse Polish notation".)  Postfix notation forms the conceptual basis for the way that arithmetic expressions are evaluated by a computer.  One important characteristic of both postfix and prefix notations is that they are unambiguous; no parentheses are needed to indicate the order of operations.<br>

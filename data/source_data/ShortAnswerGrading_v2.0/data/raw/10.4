10.4 A tree data structure in which each done has at most two children, typical called left and right nodes.  The right node is usually greater than the left node and the parent node.
10.4 A binary tree is a set of nodes that is either empty or partitioned into a root node and one or two subsets that are binary subtrees of the root. Each node can have no more than two children, a right and a left child.
10.4 A set of nodes that is either empty or partitioned into a root node and one or two subsets that are binary subtrees of the root.  Each node has at most two children, the left child and the right child.
10.4 A set of zero or more nodes, partitioned into a root node and two possibly empty sets that are binary trees. Thus, each node in a binary tree has at most two children, the left child and the right child.
10.4 A tree in which each parent has a maximum of 2 children.
10.4 a tree where each node has at most 2 children.
10.4 a tree with up to two children or a right subtree and/or a left subtree
10.4 A binary tree is a tree in which all nodes have a maximum of two degrees, or can only have two children each.
10.4 a binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children.
10.4 a tree with only 2 joints, left and right
10.4 A binary search tree is a tree that also has the condition that each node may have at maximum 2 children
10.4 a tree where each parent can have at max two children.
10.4 a list of numbers that are ordered compared to how they compare to the other numbers already added in the tree
10.4 a tree where each node can have at most 2 children.
10.4 Starting at the root node, it branches off into one or two subsets that are binary subtrees of the root.<br><br>Each node has at most two children, the left child and the right child.
10.4 A binary tree is a set of nodes that is either empty or partitioned into a root node and one or two subsets that are binary subtrees of the root. Each node has at most two children, the left child and the right child.
10.4 a tree that has a maximum of 2 children per node
10.4 a tree with elements that can contain at most two pointers
10.4 A binary tree can have only two children for each node.
10.4 a tree where every parent has only two children
10.4 A tree where every node has no more than two children
10.4 a binary tree is a special search tree where each node has either 2, 1, or 0 children
10.4 a binary tree is a special type of tree where each node can only have at maximum 2 children
10.4 A binary tree is a special type of inverted tree in which each element has only two branches below it.

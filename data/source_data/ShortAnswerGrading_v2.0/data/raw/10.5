10.5 A tree data structure where each node has a value, where the total order is defined on these values.  the left subtree contains only values less than the parent node, and vice versa for the right subtree.
10.5 A binary search tree is a binary tree where the value in any node 'n' is greater than the value in every node in n's left subtree but less than every node in n's right subtree.
10.5 A binary tree where the value in any node n is greater than the value in every node in n's left subtree, but less than the value of every node in n's right subtree.
10.5 A binary tree where the search key in any node n is greater than the search key in any node in n's left subtree, but less than the search key in any node in n's right subtree.
10.5 A tree which is split based on values. This makes it very easy to search. One can compare the desired value to the root, and if the root is greater than, we search the left side of the tree, if it is less than, we search the right side... and do the same thing recursively. 
10.5 a tree where each node has at most two nodes and the node on the left is less than the root and the node on the right is greater than the root.
10.5 a special binary tree that has a rule that all the subtrees on the right are smaller than the node value and all the subtrees on the left are larger than the node value
10.5 Binary search trees are similar to binary trees, but have been implemented to organize data in a specific way for later searching.
10.5 it is a binary tree where each node has a value, a total order is defined on these values, the left subtree of a node contains only values less than the node's value, and the right subtree of a node contains only values greater than or equal to the node's value.
10.5 A binary tree with the data organized in a specific arangment
10.5 A binary search tree is a tree that also has the condition that each node may have at maximum 2 children and where the input data is compared to the data in the tree starting with the root. If the value is smaller than the root it traverses left, if it is larger it traverses right until it becomes a leaf.
10.5 a binary tree in which the data is in order from left to right.
10.5 a tree that is set up so that it can be easily searched for numbers based on the location compared to the previous nodes. 
10.5 a binary tree where the children are ordered such that the right side is greater than the current node, and the left is less than or equal the current node.
10.5 A binary tree where the value in any node n is greater than the value in every node n's left subtree, but less than every value in n's right subtree.
10.5 A binary search tree is a finite set of nodes that is either empty or consits of a root and two disjoint binary trees call the left and right subtrees.
10.5 it is similar to a binary tree.  The keys in a nonempty left subtree (right subtree) are smaller (larger) than the key in the root of subtree.  the values in all nodes in the left subtree of a node are less than          <br>  the node value<br> the values in all nodes in the right subtree of a node are greater <br>  than the node values<br><br>
10.5 a set of numbers arranged by links. each node can contain two pointers to other elements. each node to the left of the parent is smaller and each node to the right is larger. recursive implementation implies that if traversed in order, the output would be sorted
10.5 A binary search tree is a special binary tree arranged such that every left child node contains a value less than its parent, and every right child node contains a value greater its parent.
10.5 a binary tree with a special organization of data. where the left child of the element is less than it, and the right child is larger than it.
10.5 A tree in which the smaller values are located on the left of a parent node and the larger values are located on the right of the parent node.
10.5 a binary search tree is a special tree in which each node has at most two children, labeled left child and right child
10.5 it is a binary tree where each node has a unique key, the left child of a node has only values less than that node, and the right child of each node has higher values than that node.
10.5 Binary search trees are a fundamental data structure used to construct more abstract data structures such as sets, multisets, and associative arrays.

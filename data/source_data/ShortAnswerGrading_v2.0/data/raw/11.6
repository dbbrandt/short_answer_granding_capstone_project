11.6 Iteration, performers  a series of checks and loops.
11.6 The alternative method is to use loops in the program instead of a function which calls itself. 
11.6 An alternative to solving a problem using recursive functions is to solve the problem using iteration.
11.6 Iteration, this would be more efficient and has repetition structure.
11.6 One can use iteration or by using a simple while/for loop.
11.6 iteration
11.6 Iteration. A while loop or a for loop will be able to accomplish the same desired outcome... It may be faster than recursion, but could also be harder to understand.
11.6 you can also solve the problem iteratively
11.6 iterative
11.6 Using iteration loops.
11.6 Another alternative way to solve a problem instead of using recursive functions is by using iteration.
11.6 A recursive function can often be solved using an iterative function, which runs faster, but is often more complicated.
11.6 iteration
11.6 Any recursive function can be solved using an iterative method.
11.6 Many recursive solutions may also be solved with looping control statements, such as while, for, do-while, etc.
11.6 Using an iterative function, which repeats a specified operation or set of operations until a terminating point or base case is reached.  
11.6 iteratively
11.6 using an Iterative calls
11.6 Iteration.
11.6 iteration is the alternative way to solve a problem
11.6 using an iterative solution instead
11.6 Using an iterative solution.  For, while, or do while loop.
11.6 the alternative way to solve a problem that could be solved using recursion is iteration.
11.6 Any problem solved recursively could be solved with an iterative function.<br>Iterative replacements for recursive functions may be more difficult to program, but often lead to more efficient solutions to a problem.<br>
11.6 by iteration
11.6 itteration, like a for loop, a while loop, or a do while loop
11.6 Iteration by using loops
11.6 iterative functions
11.6 iteration
11.6 the alt, way is to use a functions parameter in a call "to" function.

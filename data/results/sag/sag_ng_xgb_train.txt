Manually added two features to the test data to see if ng1 and ng2 values based on comparing the student
answer to the correct answer would help. Results were not significantly better to justify more investigation at this time.
However, the concept of having some match feature based on the answer vs. correct answer seems to be a good idea.
It would likely involve collecting examples of a decent variety of good answer variations as import to the ng calcs.
